I find that my understanding for how HTML, CSS and the DOM works has been refreshed and has improved. My blog has a better look to at and it is easy to navigate around. I also feel more confident with the box model. 
I've been finding the technical areas easier than the context writing of my blog. I tend to overthink the writing of my blog post, giving me writers block and realised that i've spent longer than needed in this area. Spending more time on this has helped the knowlege sink in, but I think I need to spend less time worrying about what I am writing and move on if I feel confident in my understanding. This is probably an area I need to time-box if I am to work more efficiently. This is something I need to work on during the next sprint as  I feel like I have taken longer than I wanted.
