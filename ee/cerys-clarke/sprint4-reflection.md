Javascript is completely new to me and I think I have learned quite a bit. I defienately know more than when I started. I made alot of notes for me to refer back to and did alot of my own research to help my understanding. 
I spent alot of time of time on this sprint without realising. This is partly becuase I took a lot of notes, which is time consuming. But also I found myself stuck on some of the code academy questions very simple mistakes such as a spelling mistake or not using a captial letter when needed. This is something I am going to have to be more aware of. 
I need to more on faster, and take in the advice Jack said about making sure you understand 80%. I spent alot of time trying to work things out which is good, but i need to speed up as I have quite a few sprints left. Im hoping I will understand Javascript alot better in the next sprint. I feel like I can understand whats going when Its explained to me or I see the code written out, however I have some way to go before I feel cofident writing my own Javascript code.
