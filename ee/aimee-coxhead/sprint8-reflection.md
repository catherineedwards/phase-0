What did I do well this sprint?<br>
I made a calculator that actually works! I also remembered how to do the CSS and I made it look like the calculator on my phone.

What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
I found trying to read parts of the other code hard like what $ meant. This is where I spent most of my time. I found that once I was able to understand the sample code it meant that I could do my own code based on what they did.

What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
After doing the sprint 7 assignments I wasn’t feeling like I knew enough to do the calculator so I put off doing it (longer than I should have). Once I got going it wasn’t too bad. Next time I need to put what happened in the last sprint aside and start with a fresh perspective.
