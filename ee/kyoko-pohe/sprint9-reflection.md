 What did I do well this sprint?

I think I managed to enjoy and get through the fun project quite well given the amount of time I had allowed myself. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint? What can I improve on next sprint?
 
 Time management was horrible at this end of phase-0. i would have loved to have extra time to revise material before bootcamp, however this is still a goal of mine to brush up on the basics during the evenings this week.
