What did I do well this sprint?
I focussed alot of effort into the design, usability and look of the website. I may have spent more time than was neccessary
as I have started the course early. I did not want to rush my way through alot of the learning. So I took more time to get use to 
vs - html, css especially. I wanted to use some of boot strap but found that for some reason there was a conflict with using bootstrap
on my website. It was throwing out some of my css fonts, in the end I knew that I will have another opportunity
later down the track to have a really good go at working with bootstrap.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't do well with relative paths, that will show defintely in my commits. I lost track of how many attempts I had
at getting them and the buttons on the buttom of the blog pages to work. As well as the drop down menu.
In the end I learned that I could have made a simpler page.  I thoroughly enjoyed the challenege of building this website.
I've always loved a good challenge.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Time keeping and being mindful of my approach to others and how I say things. I never offended anyone, but I asked a student for help
from my cohort, they were very helpful, extremely understand. I found a would put my abilities down when I didn't get something right.
I must learn to accept that at time I'm going to need help understanding something, and that I am not perfect, just a human soaking up 
everything I need to learn.
