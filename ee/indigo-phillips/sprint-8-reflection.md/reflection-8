What did I do well this sprint?

As I felt unprepared to complete this weeks challenege I decided to attempt doing different tutorials 
online. I learned alot and felt alot more confident afterwards with the few different javascript methods 
I began to slowly build my calculator confident that I had understood the methods.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I could have spent more time going over all the past work we have learnt on this phase but 
have decided to save it for the end of this phase.

What can I improve on next sprint?

My team building skills, at present I am unable to meet with my team mates. But I hope
to improve relations during the next few weeks.
