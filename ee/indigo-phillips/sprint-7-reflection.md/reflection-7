What did I do well this sprint?

I found this week I spent more week researching and going back over old notes
and sprints in an attempt to help with the challeneges.

Being honest with myself and my capabilities. Also working out where
my weaknesses lie also helps me to improve.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I have found that I spend a lot more time than is neccessary on a challenege.
Even after all the refactoring, googling methods, research and several attempts
I required the hints. In a couple of the Free Code Camp/Eloquent Challeneges
I struggled to get my code to work. There is a plethora of possiblities and
working out where the syntax is to be placed I found this week was a little
bit of a struggle.

Only after attempting and spending more time was neccesary did I look
for answers elsewhere to see where I went wrong. Before moving to the next
I would work through the answers ensuring I understood each challenege and
piece of syntax. Then taking down my own notes as a reminder.


What can I improve on next sprint?

Often in challeneges in the past two - three weeks especially I have found I
over think the challenege. I've created my own code and found there could 
have been an easier way to complete the challenege with less code.

I need to sometimes think smaller rather than bigger, as I have found this
has tripped me up this week.
