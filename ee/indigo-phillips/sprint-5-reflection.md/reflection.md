What did I do well this sprint?
This week was another giant learning curve. I leaned a lot this week 
about problem solving and how I manage my stress. I missed today's mindfulness
meditation.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
My problem solving skills need a lot of work, that much is clear.
I am aware that not every code exercise and challenge comes with set
clear instrutcions. A lot can be lost in how I understand the instructions.
I need to learn to not overthink each problem, then pseudocode, 
if no joy use other problem solving techniques.


What can I improve on next sprint?
Yes, I should clarify my sprint instructions as soon as I hit the wall
and none of the other methods worked.
