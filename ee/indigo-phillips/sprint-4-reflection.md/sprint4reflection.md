What did I do well this sprint?

With the Code Camp I thought I did a very good job. A lot of the
methodology , elements and functions came back to me. I needed little help from the hints. So I did not need to rely on that. I also didn't need any extra help.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

Interestingly enough, even though I understood and worked well
within the code camp exercisers and I remembered some of the 
methods previously used, I found the tech blog quiet challeneging. I found I could understand it more than explain it.

I found I went off track a little still trying to work out how the boxifying method worked.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I need to work on my time and minimizing my distractions from here on out and try not to get hung up on the overlook of the website. As my learning evolves I intend to get better.
