What did I do well this sprint?
Asked a lot of questions. Probably a lot of silly stupid questions I later found
would be answered. But I had to learn that lesson a couple of times to get that right.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I conitnued, through my own stress, frustration and forgetfulness forget to time a lot of tasks.
I find the amount of reading, tutorials and things my brain was absorbing was too much. I wasn't taking enough breaks or disconnecting from the work load. It often ran through my mind at night. So sleeping was an issue.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Correct time keeping on toogle
Search for the correct answer before asking a question and ensure its the right question.
When short breaks don't work it pays for me to disconnect completely, step away, remembering I have more time up my sleeve to complete phase zero. Especially when I am stressed or feel overwhelemed I found that I benefited from taking a day off.
