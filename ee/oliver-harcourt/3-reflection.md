What did I do well this sprint?
This sprint I time-boxed really well, I didn't spend too long on things I didn't need to and got through it pretty quickly!

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I could've tried more css changes and styling the website more to get a better feel for how that all works but it can quickly use up more time than necessary!

What can I improve on next sprint?
Attend a check-in!!!!! I ended up taking good advantage of the weather at ruapehu on wednesday so went skiing instead but still feel bad missing them!
