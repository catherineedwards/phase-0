This sprint I think I dealt with stress levels well. A few times I did things that I thought could've been the end of the world (thought I had deleted everyones work on github for a bit until I realised the whole point of github is that even if I had done that it'd be fine)

I didn't timebox well and ended up spending more time on things that I probably shouldnt have and just moved on (CSS beautification)

Next sprint I will try and adopt the pomodoro timing technique and get a bit more productive. Also be a bit better at recording my time spent on things. More often than not I realised I had forgotten to time things on toggl.
