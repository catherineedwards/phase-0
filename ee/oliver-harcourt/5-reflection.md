 What did I do well this sprint?
 This sprint I was happy with the way I perservered. I definitely had some pretty tough moments where it didn't seem to make any sense. But I think I'm slowly getting it...

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I didn't stay calm very well. I got flustered a few times with the code and not understanding it.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Keep calm and carry on, there's no need to be flustered, it's just coding and no reason to get all worked up!
