This sprint I think I dealt with stress levels well again, a few occasions of not knowing what went wrong and working throuhg figuring out what it might be and solving. Didn't have to go into the space to get help this time too! I also time-boxed a lot better rather than getting distracted or carried away doing unnecesary tasks. Maybe because I'm a bit tighter on time now.

I'm feeling quite positive about the way that sprint went but if I had to pick something that I dont think I did well on it would be not attending a check in... 

My goal for next sprint is to attend a check-in!.
