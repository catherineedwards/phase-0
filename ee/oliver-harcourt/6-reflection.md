What did I do well this sprint?
I feel like I'm grasping the concepts a bit better this sprint, probably because I'm being more patient with myself.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't spend as much time on the stretch exercises as I could've done, I'm keen to go back to those and work through them though.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Get a bit more in depth with understanding the concepts
