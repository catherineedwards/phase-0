What did I do well this sprint?
I kept cool under pressure, JavaScript is hard! I was definitely starting to get a bit too comfortable...

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I think I could've spent more time trying to fully understand the JavaScript concepts. Hopefully I'll have plenty of time to revise in future though.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Try to explore the concepts a bit more to get a better understanding
