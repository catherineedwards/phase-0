What did I do well this sprint?
    <p> Actually hard to pick something :(</p>
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    <p> Umm everything. I panicked, I procrastinated, and I ended up just moving on because I don't get it. </p>
What can I improve on next sprint?
    <p>Time management and not panicking</p>
