What did I do well this sprint?
    <p> I used my resesarch skills effectively when I got stuck on free code camp - there were lots of you tube videos that were helpful </p>
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    <p> Probably resorted to youtube and the answers too much - I had a lot on this week at work so felt time pressured to just get the course done. I got distracted a lot during the exercises because there were so many and I found the content quite boring.  </p>
What can I improve on next sprint?
    <p> Stop getting distracted on my phone every 10 minutes! </p>
