What did I do well this sprint?
    <p> Perseverence, and time efficiency </p>
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    <p> I rushed through things - I didn't fully follow along with the Udacity videos because I didn't feel like I had enough time </p>
What can I improve on next sprint?
    <p> Take my time, think logically, DO the practice </p>
