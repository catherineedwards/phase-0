What did I do well this sprint?
    <p> I really stuck with certain images and didn't get frustrated - despite some things taking me hours to figure out. </p>
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    <p> I didn't follow the grid process as I should have. I wanted my website to look a certain way so kind of went off track
    when I thought the skeleton/grid wouldn't help me get there - but in reality it was a learning exercise so I should have focussed
    on what we were trying to learn rather than going off track. I will go over it again this weekend to make up for it - but in future I will follow the process better.  </p>
What can I improve on next sprint?
    <p> Follow the process, invest at the beginning so I don't have to come back to things later </p>
