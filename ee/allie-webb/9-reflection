What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I stayed on track with my goals to have certain things completed by a certain time, with the exception of the hiccup while I was in recovery.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I wish I had gotten to know a few more people in my cohort. I probably should have developed a few better eating habits such as snacking in a healthy way, but I did improve my eating habits in most areas.

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
I have learnt to take short breaks, to meditate, to exercise, to stretch, to get outside and get some sun and air, and that even when you've been working on something for ages and feel like giving up, you might still have a breakthrough.
