What did I do well this Sprint?
    I allocated my time well and managed to finish with time to spare.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I don't think I followed the Udacity videos well. I kept getting confused at what I was supposed to do and what I was supposed to watch. I was a bit overwhelmed by the end of each lesson.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    I am going to try to review each step before moving on so I can make sure I've done everything necessary.
