What did I do well this Sprint?
    I think I worked at a good pace and managed to finish before my target of mid-Wednesday

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I found myself getting very distracted in the afternoons. I tried taking breaks, doing exercise, having small healthy snacks, etc. but still found it difficult. I will continue to try new things but ultimately hope that I will get used to working at a computer all day which is the opposite of hospo.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    I am going to try more meditation to improve on my focus and calm.
