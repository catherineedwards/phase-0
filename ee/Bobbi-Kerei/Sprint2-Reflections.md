What did I do well this sprint?

Focus on getting things done in ordered and c areful way. I'm really proud of what i've done this sprint.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I broke GitHub. Have hit a point were I can't push anything to Git Hub at all. Working on getting a friend to 
help me figure out what I did here. Just frustarted that i don't ahve more knowledge too understand what i did.
 
 What can I improve on next sprint?

Use this as a lesson for my next sprints on how to not break gitHub again and if i do then how to fix it.
