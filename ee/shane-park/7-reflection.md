 What did I do well this sprint?<br>
    I think I am able to start communication with other member, and I try to talk to them.<br>
    Also, I learned javascript array and string function. It was really useful things to mamipulate strings  
 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
    Acutally, It was very difficult to understand other people's codes. Especially, short codes are really hard to uderstand.  
    In 2015, there was some changes in Javascript. For example, delcaring variables, new definition syntax in function and others.  
    Sometimes, I could not understand the codes and syntax becuase I familiar with traditional programming language like C.  
    But Javascript is very flexable language. Even we do not need to declare variables, and need to mactch the number of arguments in   fucntion. I was thinking that the readability in coding is very important ,but when it comes to making short codes it is really   hard to understand the meaning of codes.  
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
    I will try to change my coding style slightly and I should develope to understand others Javscript codes.
