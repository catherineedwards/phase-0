[Phase-0 reflection]<br>
 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0? <br>
 I was able to keep my confidence that I will be a good web developer through learning phase-0<br><br>

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?<br>
 It was a great apportunty to remind my web development skills. It makes me to realize my lack of knowledge in coding.<br>
 Also, I could learn valuable skills which enhance my social relationship.<br><br>

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?<br>
 I learned time management. I thought that keeping focus on coding for long time is the best. But it was not the best way,<br>
 and it is a inefficient way. Also, I realized that respecting other people and cooperative mind generate much better result.<br>
 I wish that I wnat to maintain my current mindset, and I will do my best from there.<br><br>
