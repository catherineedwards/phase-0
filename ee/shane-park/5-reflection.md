What did I do well this sprint?  
I think I have been proper dubugging process with console.log function. Some times I was blocked from unsusual errors  
that I did not expect. But I was able to solve the issues through the tracing method.    

What didn't I do well this sprint?  
I was unable to remember various functions in Javascript, so I should find the functions once I made codes.  
I think it was really difficult to remember it.  

What can I improve on next sprint?  
I think that I am going to make technical sample pages in my blog, and I will write useful method in JavaScript.  
If I block to apply appropriate fuctions and attributes I will refer it.  Also, I will try to use a various problem solving method  
while making new codes.
