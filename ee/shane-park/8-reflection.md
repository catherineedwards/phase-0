 What did I do well this sprint?<br>
 I think that the calculator was awesome because I made a fucntion which is similar with eval().<br><br>
 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
 Actually, the calculator is not perfect, so it has minor problems. I could not manage the time during sprint-8.<br>
 Thus, I was unalbe to have enough time to fix the calculator. I think I had done too much focus on making eval function. <br><br>
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
 I herad there is a personal project from Sam. I will try to make good open source project with javascrip.<br>
 First of them, I want to review my all phase-0 tasks from sprint-9.<br><br>
