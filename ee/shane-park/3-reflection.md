1.What did I do well this sprint?<br>
I was able to understand using templates, I made both index template and blog templateSkeleton CSS, and it was really useful because<br> it was reusable source code. Also, I experienced various CSS templates like a skeleton, and I found to use the professional CSS and my own custom template.<br>

2.What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
I still was unable to type well, I have been felt that I should effort to increase the speed of typing.<br>

3.What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
I really want to enhance menu function in the website because there is a menu that should be categorized.<br>
It needs dynamic function using javascript. I hope that I will learn useful script to operate HTML elements.<br>
