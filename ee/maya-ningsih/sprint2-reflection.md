What did I do well this sprint?
I did well in achieving my target for adding extra features on the blog pages. I implemented CSS to my blogs. I also reuse the same layout across a few pages i.e HTML, CSS, DOM part 1 & 2. I also added a few extra feature on my navbar menu by using javascript function. 
 
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I spent too much time playing with CSS, making a lot of perhaps unnecessary changes. I try to implement the grid based design where I can. I tried to use it on the main page of the https://ambomaya.github.io/AmboMaya.github.io/index.html. While it works on the full page, the layout doesn't support the responsive design. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
To solve the above issue with my main page grid layout, I will look into implementing the @media CSS feature on my next sprint. I should be spending more time reading and understanding the concept like CSS positioning, flex and grid, rather than more time on making a lot of changes on the layout and keep checking the effect for every changes I made. I realised that's not very productive.
