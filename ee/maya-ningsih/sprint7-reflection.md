This sprint was good for me. I feel good because I was able to acknowledge my area of weaknesses and be resilient with my failure. I know this only the begining but at least this is a good start of the tough journey that I'm preparing for. 

What I didn't do well
In the middle of the sprint I had a self-doubt. I'll be honest that even a basic algorithm and simple math I found difficult. At some stage I feel that I was an auto pilot mode, where I do things but nothing sink in. However that feeling last as soon as I solved more and more tutorials. 

What can I improve
I need to spend more time doing rather than learning concepts. During this sprint I've been making progress but will need to more coding.
