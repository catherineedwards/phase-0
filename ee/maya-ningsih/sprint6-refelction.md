 I managed to get through the end of the sprint :)
 I did well for reaching out for help.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Spent so much time searching for a way out without timeboxing myself. Need to be selective what information is relevant for the task i'm doing. Write pseudo code or even writting down requirements before straight to coding. I struggled to start putting what I know together without help.

What I should do next time?
Write the process down to get better understanding of what it is I want to tackle. I should learn how the application work before it's even possible to start writting codes. Eliminate assumptions.
