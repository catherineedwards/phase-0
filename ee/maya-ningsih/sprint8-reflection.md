I completed the UI part of this assignment fine. I was able to make assertive decision on what HTML elements I needed to use that can be used when writing JS code. 

Building calculator challenge was very hard for me. I thought I should have done this sprint differently. Eventhough using the calculator is easy but knowing the smalll details of how it works is a different story. I can learn a lot from this print how I should develop my understanding of a project before I start coding. I found that I need more practise from writing a good pseudocode to breaking things down to smaller pieces. 

I also struggled with writing the logic for building the calculator. I think understand the concept of local and global variable. However I found it hard to understand how function works: requirement to build a function and knowing where in the application I can execute the function. For example, to make the equal function work, you can just call other functions which you previously created i.e function which updates the total and refresh the display with the new total. Until this point, I still write code based on examples and unable to come up with my own solution without any help. I should practise more on understanding the logic of an app, write pseudocode based on my understanding and break task into smaller steps.
