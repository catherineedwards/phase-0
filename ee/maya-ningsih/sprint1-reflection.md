What did I do well this sprint? 
I spent more time in get familiar with github and the terminal. I can now nagivate around the terminal after practising to use more command line for this. 
I did well with following each steps on sprint tasks. It's good to revisit my brief knowledge on HTML and CSS after a long time. I feel comfortable working ticket 4868 (creating github blog). 

What didn't I do well this sprint? 
I was getting ahead of myself. I need to stop racing myself and learn how to slow the process down. I need to work on the planning to make sure that I don't get trapped on spending too much on a few things. I realise reflectiong is actually not that easy but agree that it's a better way of learning. 

What can I improve on the next sprint? 
More practice on git pull and push processes. Need to get comfortable on resolving conflict file and merging.
