What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
    I completed all nine sprints before bootcmap starts. 
    I still enjoy learning to code eventhough I haven't code as much as I should. 
    I love creating visual things eventhough I struggle with writing the logic for making an interactive program.  

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
    There are still many javascript beginner concepts that I need to get grasp on. Some obvious onea are: creating chain Object, manipulating array, switches, ternary operation etc.. 
    I wish I'd be more persistance when dealing with difficult concepts and not let my worries be on the way. I thought I should have put electronic resources so they are easy to find when I need them. Sometime I spend more time searching for things than the actual learning. I wish I made more effort to approach teacher or approach cohorts to set up time for group study or something similar. 

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
    Reflection method really helps me to keep track how much I have learnt and identify the area I need to improve on. Practise make it easy even for a very simple problem. Revisiting difficult concepts will also help even it means concepts that maybe easy for other people but i still found it hard to understand. I have not develop this but I admit that I need to be persistance when dealing with complexity and ask questions.
