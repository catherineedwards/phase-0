What did I do well this sprint?
No issues with navigating around git for pulling, committing and pushing files and solving file conflicts. 
At the beginning of sprint 4, I was a bit nervous because this is the real start of learning programming language. For most of the questions on the tutorial I managed to solve the problems. For the ones I found hard, I begin with looking up for the best way to answer, if I can't solve it then I would search for the solution and try understand the concept then. 
 
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 Learning how to stay calm when you're stuck and taking time to understand the confusing part. I easily get worried and nervous and I think when you want to learn something new and difficult, having these feelings isn't going help. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Need to practise staying calm and collected, be resillient and have fun in my learning process.
