This sprint was a fun sprint for me. I'm learning a lot from doing the challenges. I did well to get the solution done wquickly for some question. Adding a bit more to my confidence know that I can apply the concept to codes that work. 

I didn't do well
The instruction for one of the challenges is to look at the provided example. I assumed that I will need to use the exact method and copied the exact same way and apply to my code. A friend pointed out that the first part of it is incorrect. So I need to learn to question more and avoid blindly copying an example. 

What can I do next time to improve
It's a process I think. I will research more if unsure and try understand how exactly a line of code behave using google chrome dev tool for example.
