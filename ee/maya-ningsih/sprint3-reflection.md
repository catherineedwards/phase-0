What did I do well this sprint?
I learnt to meditate more regularly. In the beginning of the sprint I was a bit indecisive whether to reuse my work for from the previous sprint as I started applying the css and design concept early. I consulted with Kelly and felt happy that I did. I redesigning my blog differently using skeleton framework which is more straight forward and easier to use. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Maybe stick to process of product more. 

What can I improve on next sprint?
More trial and errors with understanding CSS behaviour. Need to read more on a lot of css features such as positioning, flex, overflow, etc.
