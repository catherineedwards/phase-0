 What did I do well this sprint?
    I think I did well in this sprint by really enjoying the process of having to figure out what is going on. There was quite a bit of knowledge to learn and learn to utilise. I can't say im comfortable with it all yet but i think the process I went about learning this was good. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    Not being able to absorb and utilise what was available. I think from the different tutorials there were many techniques and functions that I would have loved to done more with them. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    Continue to get better at problem solving and not just learn the knowledge, learn to use the knowledge.
