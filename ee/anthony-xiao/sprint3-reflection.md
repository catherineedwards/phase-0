What did I do well this sprint?
    For this sprint what went well was getting stuck on how to implement my new designs on the page and able to fight through it and eventually getting the page as close to what I want as possible. 
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    Although it was close it is still not the site that I would like, but hopefully I can get closer to it as phase-0 continues. 
What can I improve on next sprint?
    For the next sprint I would like to test myself further on implementing more challenging styling or features to keep pushing my skills.
