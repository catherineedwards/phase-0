What did I do well this sprint?
    I was very happy with how I continued to work to solve the minesweeper problems I ran into. I was able to use different problem solving techniques, and with a little help from my peers I was able to use those hints to keep going. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    It did take longer than what I had planned so would love to be able to be more on schedule going forward. 
    
 What can I improve on next sprint?
    continue to use what I have learned and be able to combine them into the next task.
