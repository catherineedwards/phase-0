 What did I do well this sprint?
    I think getting to understand the concepts of javascript and having mulitple places to learn from (freecodecamp and codeacademy) was a really good way to learn and pick up the knowledge
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    Some of the concepts took me a bit longer than expected to understand but eventually did get there with some hints. 
 What can I improve on next sprint?
    This sprint over all took longer than i had planned, for the next sprint i would like to stick to my planned times to complete a sprint.
