 What did I do well this sprint?
    I think for this sprint I did well on figuring what and why certain parts of the code were breaking. Really getting more familiar with the debugg tool as well as using breaking points to follow the flow of the code. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    the calculator was quite hard and I did end up having to get pointers from peers to figure out parts of the code. Would love to try again on my own to write it without any help. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    get more efficient with code, write shorter codes so it doesnt become messy. Also imrpove making the codes more reusable. rather than having to label everything one by one.
