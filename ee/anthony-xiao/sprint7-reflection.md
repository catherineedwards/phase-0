 What did I do well this sprint?
    For this sprint I think I did well on really trying out the different problem solving techniques when I was doing the freecodecamp tasks. Loved being able to tackle the problems bit by bit before getting the final results. 
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I didnt get as many of the challenges done as I would like but even after the sprint I will continue to work through them.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    Being able to bring up the different functions and codes faster, without having to read and google something to remind myself what to do and how to use it.
