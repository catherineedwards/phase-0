 What did I do well this sprint?
    I think for this sprint I did well in taking in the thinking and strucutre of html and css and realise what I did wrong when I initially created my site. What I need to change and pay off my 'debt' early
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    There is quite a bit of reaing so I am doing my best to remember all I can but realising that is not my strong suit. What I am trying is to action all that was read at least once to make it more memorable
 What can I improve on next sprint?
    Being more tidy going forward with the coding.
