 What did I do well this sprint?
    I think what I did well in this sprint was take in all the details of the readings. Trying to read all the articles and get as much practice in as possible to make sure I am laying down my foundation. Also knowing that I picked things up without too many challenges gave me confidence going forward
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    With wrapping up work and some family events going on this week the time I had to do the sprint was a bit choppy and wasn't able to give it as much time as I would like.
What can I improve on next sprint?
    I can improve on the speed of how I pick up new functions and at the same time not lose the quality and details of learning it all.
