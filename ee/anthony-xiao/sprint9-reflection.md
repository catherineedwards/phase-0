 What did I do well this sprint?
    What went well in this sprint is I gave my self a good amount of time to keep going back to what we have learnt so far and review on them. As well as use them in mini projects to get more practice.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    I did find that for some concepts from previous sprints I have a bit of rust and need to keep coding to keep those knowledge fresh
