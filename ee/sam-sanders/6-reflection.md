What did I do well this sprint?

I worked out some new tricks when playing around with the minesweeper stretch goals.
On top of my meditating and typing exercises.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

My toggle time keeping was a little off and the haste with which I finished the sprint was as well.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Time keeping, finish Sprint in a timely manner. Get into campus regularly.


Side note to self, during this sprint I had to find a new place to live, a vehicle to transport myself around (motorcycle and remember/relearn how to ride one) and a storm which took out the power for just over 3 days. So all in all 
I forgive myself for slacking regarding the expanse time from start to finish of this sprint .... but I shan't be so forgiving next time :D
