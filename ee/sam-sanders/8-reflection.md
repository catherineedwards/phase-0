What did I do well this sprint?

I built my calculator without asking for help and without reverse pseudo coding the example
until I got to the shortening of the functions part .. am a happy chappie :D

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I guess if i were to nit pick, I would say that Iput off the cultural blog ... but thats because
I knew i had the time and SIY became monotonous for me some time back.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Already actually on it ... and I'm happy thus far :D
