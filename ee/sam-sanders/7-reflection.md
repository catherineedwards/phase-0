What did I do well this sprint?

Got back into my good habit's after a brief return to the none code life.
Didn't let recursion go over my head.
Got better at leaving comments and pseudo coding.
Gained more gusto for problem solving (yes ... I know ... me ... and even more of that)

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't get it done as soon as I would have liked to.
I didn't get any better at toggling ... but then again I do realize that using a timer during a learning
process is in no way the same and when timing work ... I'll get there but more-so when its work and not
the natural flow of learning (that is needed for learning to actually happen) 

What can I improve on next sprint?

Get it done faster
