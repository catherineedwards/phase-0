What did I do well this sprint?

My blogs and webpages are coming along nicely. My understanding of HTML, CSS, the DOM and how the interact with each other is coming along nicely, and I am getting to grips with bootstrap and its place in web dev / team collaborations.
Did well with more slack communicating.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I did not get along with Udacity, I find their way of teaching to be ... discombobulated, disjointed and somewhat akin to a montage of how to become a webdev. Looks kinda cool, but doesn't really give you what you need to get there .. and always misses out the hard and time consuming bits :D
Anyway, because of that I went off and learnt what was required of me re sprint-2 and what their (based off aside {float:left}) list of lessons, from the web and phase-0 repo. So i guess thats a pro and a con.
I was worse with toggl this sprint vs last, because I went off and did so much reading/practice outside of what was instructed ... and so didn't record that in toggl.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Not get disheartened when content I am to consume is not best suited for me and just move on to finding what works for me quicker.
