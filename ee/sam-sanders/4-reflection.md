Getting to grips with a sizable chunk of JavaScript fundamentals, meditation and typing practice.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

Stop myself from getting a block when reading the 3rd chapter or trying to understand some of FCC instructions.

What can I improve on next sprint?

DO what i did to remedy the above short comings ... but sooner. I went off and learnt the JS fundamentals from SoloLearn, 
because they are great to simplifying and aptly conveying the basics so i always knew where I was and why.
