 What did I do well this sprint?
I spent a nice block of time on the materials to go through it and put a good amount of effort into the minesweeper game and troubleshooting it.



 What didn't I do well this sprint?
In the beginning the game wasn't going so well and I had to go a few steps back in order to find and tackle it. In the end I was better off deleting some big chunks of the original code to create some clarity. Although I don't feel I changed much of the original code, I believe it was caused by some curly braces in the wrong place. Also I did not commit code to GIT as much as I should have



 What can I improve on next sprint?
Dedicate more time towards QA, clearer indentations and debug while testing. For some reason I had the impression it was working fine untill it was not. + more Git commits!
