  What did I do well this sprint?
I was able to put more time into the indivual tasks, I already knew some bits about HTML and CSS but going through this sprint opened up to me how much I did not. 


  What didn't I do well this sprint?
Some of the videos went trough the content very fast and did not give more granular information about why something is being done. Like frameworks, the actual piece on the framework went really fast and I feel some more information could have been given. 


  What can I improve on next sprint?
More time and dedication :) And keep on checking if the Toggl timer is running, I have had a few times that this would stop straight after I started it.
