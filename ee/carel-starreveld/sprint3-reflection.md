What did I do well this sprint?

Rewriting my blog went very well, I was able to fix most of the issues I came across.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

It took longer then expected to pick up after I left off for holiday. Actually coming up with the ideas to rewrite the website took more time and when I started converting my wireframe to live I found out that some of my design elements weren't thought through that well.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Take more time to think things through but trying not getting lost in the details.
