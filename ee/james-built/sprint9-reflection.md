What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I did a good job of organising the resources I would need to approach each sprint and making sure I achieved the required competencies. I feel that coming out of the end of the sprints I have a good base knowledge and have enhanced my process of learning as well which is something I am quite pleased with. I think I made a good effort at advancing my soft skills and expect to develop these even quicker during the bootcamp itself. Also I think I did well at reflecting on my progress after each sprint as this was a habit I wasn't previously in so I'm glad to have picked it up.

I also think I did a good job at problemsolving issues as I came across them.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I would like to have had a better routine to my work. When I was able to sit down for several hours at a time I made consistent progress but I think if I had been more disciplined at setting the time I would work and the time I would let off steam I could have covered even more. I'm glad that I had the chance to do a good review of all the principles covered in the sprints ahead of going to bootcamp but I also wanted to do more of a site re-design to put these into practice and unfortunately I ran out of time to do this.

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

As I discussed above I am pleased to have developed the habit of reflection on my learning, I can feel how this helps solidify what I know and highlight what I should work more on. Having spent more time meditating than I have ever done in the past I feel this has helped develop calmness and confidence and also to quiet my mind when it gets distracted which should be a big help over the coming weeks.

Phase 0 has also sparked in me even more curiosity in the computer sciences than I had before. This passion should help carry me through the long days and nights of hard work to come!
