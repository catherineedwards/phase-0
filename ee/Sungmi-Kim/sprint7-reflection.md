# Reflection Sprint-7

### What did I do well this sprint?
When I was stuck at basic algorithm, searched on google \
to figure it what method I needed for.
### What didn't I do well this sprint?
I spent so much time to search on google, the first it was \
difficult to understand what was the question and the second I \
found out answer was simple but I tried to solve with the difficult way
### What can I improve on next sprint?

I hope my backup study for data structure helping me to understand \
basic Java Script algorithm.
