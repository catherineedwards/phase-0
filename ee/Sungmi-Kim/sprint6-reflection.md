## Sprint6 Reflection time
my favorite the markdown time :satisfied::kissing_smiling_eyes:

### What did I do well this sprint?

I googled for getting to know more about JavaScript code, \

### What didn't I do well this sprint?

### What can I improve on next sprint?

I am currently back up studying
