## Reflection time 

### What did I do well thin sprint? 
I backup studying a lot for array,object and nested array,object.\
I searched each concept via w3school and mdn, feel like we are the \
best freinds.

### What didn't I do well this sprint?
freecodecamp was a big stress to me, I understood the basic `JavaScript`\
but when they are combined I was stuck and really had difficulty to pass \
through even I don't understand how my code was working finally after I passed. \

### What can I improve on next sprint?
I am repeating the freecodecamp at the moment before moving to Sprint5. \
I hope JavaScript doesn't hate me .... :smile:
