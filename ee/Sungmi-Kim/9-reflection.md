# Phase0 reflection

### What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I was very worried at the begining that I am not able to finish 
Phase-0 before the bootcamp, because I had a tough time with 
the gitHub, so was thinking if I couldn't understand this one how 
possible to understand other thing. However, I am now albe to use 
the gitHub and coding as well, this is a big improvement in 3months. 

### What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I have done lots of backup studying, but still not sure is it 
enough for in Bootcamp. I am currently focusing all basic \JavaScript concepts and CSS grid, hope this is helping me through the bootcamp.

### What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

I couldn't do much the communication, and the communication will \help me more than doing my self. I am really looking forward to working with hihi students!!
