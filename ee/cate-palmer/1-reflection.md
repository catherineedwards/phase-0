Why is reflection important?

Reflection has been shown through research to be a fundamental part of the learning process, because it allows learners to ask questions like ‘What went wrong?’ when the answer isn’t directly obvious - and to do the analytical work required to make sense of setbacks and learn from them. It’s a key ingredient for moving knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.

What did I do well this week?

I think I did a good job this week of following my own internal sense of when I needed to do a bit more research on a topic before doing the task associated with that particular material - knowing when I needed to get more of an overview of how something worked before I was able to use that overall sense to do the specific steps required for a task (and before I would know where to go to find the specific pieces of information I would need to gather while working on it).

What could I have done to improve?

The flip side of what I mentioned as the thing I thought I did well is that there were a few times where I think I went a bit too far into the side-research and lost sight of the overall picture of why I was doing that research. I think there's a difficult balance to strike between pushing forward with a task and doing the background work necessary to understand why you’re doing it. I tend towards the meticulous end of things when it comes to doing work of most kinds, and part of that is that I tend to do a lot of research as part of my process and often move a bit more slowly than some people. As long as I don’t veer all the way into destructive perfectionism, it’s an approach that tends to work fairly well for me most of the time in terms of my general learning style.
