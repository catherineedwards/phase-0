- What did I do well this sprint?

I explored the possibilities of CSS redesign quite thoroughly and did any extra reading I felt I needed to on using frameworks such as Skeleton (and particularly the grid system).

-  What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn’t plan my process very well and got caught up quite a bit on slightly perfectionistic tangents (and then lost track of the bigger picture of my process).

-  What can I improve on next sprint?

I’d like to approach the next sprint in a more methodical way and take notes as I go along so I can return to what I’ve been doing and understand where I was going with things even after a break.
