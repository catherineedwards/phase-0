* What did I do well this sprint?

Juggled life commitments and study. There was a death in my family and a funeral midweek, but I knew I had to stay on top of study so I got up one morning at 3am to do a days work before we got in the car to go up for the funeral, and I studied Sat to catchup.

I also took awesome notes the whole sprint, which made the assignments much easier as I had paid really specific attention to all of the fiddly js things rather than just get through and complete the tutorials.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

Meditate or exercise. I felt like I didn't have time, and I was extremely tired from ruining my sleep cycle getting up so early one day and driving home through the night another.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Now that I'm settled into my new place and back on top of things, I look forward to doing better for myself with exercise and meditation.
