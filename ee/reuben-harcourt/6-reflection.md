* What did I do well this sprint?

Problem solved! And timeboxed. I set myself 2 hours to try to incorporate one of the stretch goals and stopped after I hit a roadblock and time was up. The next morning I gave myself another 30 minutes to dig into it and successfully completed it. It was an awesome feeling after having given up the day before and feeling ok about trying my best.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

Missed check in again! I didn't think it would be happening with Anzac day but checked into Slack later in the day and saw I missed it.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Browsing the sprint capabilities and overview resources before I get stuck in. I forgot to do that last sprint and the beginning was quite overwhelming because I had clearly missed some training.
