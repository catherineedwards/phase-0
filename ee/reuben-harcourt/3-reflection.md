* What did I do well this sprint?

I think I did really well technically. Everything I set out to do on the new site I accomplished without too much trouble. I'm getting really good at googling the problem, and inspecting how things are done on other sites.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

I've had really low motivation. I managed to get myself at least two full days ahead of my own schedule, really wanting to give myself wiggleroom for when it comes to some of the more complicated things, but lost both of those days this week indulging in hobbies and personal projects.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Getting back into my self-enforced good habits. Timeboxing, having breaks and meals at times that make sense, exercise. This will definitely help my motivation.
