* What did I do well this sprint?

Commented my code well to make it readable! And chose to change scope on my project when it became too much. I was trying to redesign my website towards the end of the sprint as I had spare time, and when it became obvious it was going to take much longer than I thought to get what I wanted to get done done, I rejigged my plans to implement something simpler and move on.

Also I've been great on my exercise.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

Work at the pace I would have liked. I had three very slow days in the middle of the week as I felt on top of things and gave myself a break.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Come into campus more to make sure I'm in an environment conducive to getting work done. I'm going to come in 4 days. It also makes sure I do a good blat of exercise each day as I walk from the back of Newtown
