* What did I do well this sprint?

I stuck at the tasks and challenges in js until I properly understood what was happening. But I didn't go crazy needing to work it out on my own. Once I got to the point where I didn't understand what to try next or how to go about it, I went to the hints and read through people's help and applied it until I understood. I learned the most from people's comments in there, and avoided the huge frustration I could have put myself through from fixating on getting it myself with no help.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't do much exercise as I was criminally underslept, and since deciding to move house it's been hard to motivate myself to start a new routine swimming lanes when my whole routine is about to be uprooted again.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Next sprint I'll be in the new house, so will start lane swimming at Kilbirnie pool that's just oevr the hill, and starting the morning with a 20 minute walk.
