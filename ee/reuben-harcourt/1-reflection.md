* What did I do well this sprint?

Learnt some great timeboxing tricks and habits to start applying. The tomato timer is gonna help me out a lot. I also managed to get everything working smoothly on my new windows computer, having just switched from Mac, which I've always been worried would be a really difficult change.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

I was a bit of a loose cannon with my time at the start - and with using the time I do have efficiently. I only tracked the time in toggl that I was head-down earphones-on sytudying, and saw that while I've sat at this desk for 30 odd hours this week as of writing this, I only recorded 21 hours on toggl.

I also don't think I followed the expected assignment flow in waffle very well, I was jumping between them ticking off a task here and a task there. There seemed to be a lot of repetition so I kept jumping around assuming I must have missed something.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Note-taking. I've bookmarked a tonne of great resources but want notes on basic css, html and command line principles to refer to to quickly jog the memory too. That's what I'll review tonight and tomorrow.
