* What did I do well this sprint?

Kept at the js algorithm problems in freecodecamp. I would put them aside if I hit a roadblock and come back later, often with a fresh idea/approach. It made it less torturous for sure and I felt good about the amount that I completed.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

Generally didn't do a lot of work. Personal things came up and I prioritized them and me-time.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

Getting back into daily routines. Setting an alarm to get up, starting work by 8, then rewarding myself with breaks.
