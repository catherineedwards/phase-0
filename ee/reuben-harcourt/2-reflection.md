* What did I do well this sprint?

I did a good bit of improvising with css while going through the Udacity tutorials, and managed to timebox tasks well. 

I'm really proud of myself for having the self-control to select a simple website feature to implement in my blog, where, knowing me, I would usually go for the big fish like a background header image that intermittently changes photos or something, and sink hours and hours into it, possibly burning myself out or causing a unneccessary frustration and anxiety when I find I can't pull it off. It was actually a big step for me to choose something achievable and trust I'll learn the things I want more when the time comes.

* What didn't I do well this sprint?

I was going to start an exercise schedule since I'm barely moving from my computer chair at the moment but I didn't do it.

Didn't do the best job of tracking time in toggl either, I definitely had it on for the majority of time but I have this habit of turning it off when I make a coffee or something and forgetting to turn it back on, or on a break from the pomodoro timer. I need to treat it more like a work situation where I track the time I'm "at work" / "at study" rather than billable hours or I'll keep forgetting to turn it back on and keep only capturing productive hours and letting the unproductive time fall through the net. I know the unproductive time is actually doing a lot for me too, even if it's just giving my brain the rest it needs to be on again for the next 2 hours, so needs to be included.

* What can I improve on next sprint?

The above. Tomorrow I'll start 2pm swims at Freyburg pool to see if that's a quiet time where the lanes aren't chocka.
