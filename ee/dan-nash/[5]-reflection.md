This sprint was my favorite so far, I get a huge hit of endorphins from problem solving in javascript, so excited for sprint 6. I think I did well this sprint, stayed focused and worked hard. I could improve on practicing more, I have a feeling of fear when approaching challenges and the experience of being blocked and panicking, I think this will be overcome through persistence.
