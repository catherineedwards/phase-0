I feel quite happy with the design of my website, It is such a productive way to learn, problem solving by trying to realize a particular design. I didn't use my time as well as past sprints and starting to feel stressed, I think that I got hung up on the visual elements of my redesign- as it is hardwired in my brain to think this way from 5 years of art school. Moving my self to Wellington also effected my pace this week. In the next sprint I will try and be more focused and dedicated to the material.
