This was the hardest sprint for me by far, I think overall I could have done much better, I was really hard on myself every time I failed and didn't end up resolving the main problem in my minesweeper code. That my game-board generator only worked with a 3x3 grid. I am going to come back to this and hopefully resolve it. When I look back I think I learnt a lot this sprint and hopefully it will show in the next sprint. I am a bit scared of failure in the coming sprints, but I need to remember the journey over destination goal.
