What I did well in this sprint
I think I used my time wisely and applied some new skills in regard to managing tasks and utilizing breaks to refresh and re-motivate.
I think I followed instructions well and followed up interesting leads with free learning. 

What I didn't do well this sprint
I am not sure if I showed the expected amount of understanding for CSS and HTML in the creation of my blog, so I await feedback with this. Hopfully in the coming sprint I can catch up on anything I missed.
I could have managed stress better, I feel like I have to prove to myself that I can complete two sprints in a week so I will hit my target to start in the ruru cohort.

What can I imporove on next sprint
Taking my time and getting better at knowing how long tasks generaly take me, so I can stop worrying about failure.
