What did I do well in this sprint?
I spent quite alot of time outside of finishing the sprint, thinking and researching HTML and CSS, I am finding it really interesting and intuitive. 
What didn't I do well this sprint?
Its taking me awhile to get used to turning on toggl, as I am so scattered in my research and work on my computers, its hard to keep track.
What can I improve for next sprint?
Write text in word so I can spell check my pages, and make a more accurate time-sheet.
