I enjoyed the open ended nature of this sprint, tying together all the disparate elements we have learned so far into a coherent whole. I found myself often feeling not smart enough to manage the abstract thought required of a coder, but pushed through a lot of big obstacles that seemed way beyond my ability range. I am looking forward to bootcamp and refreshing the material over the weekend.
