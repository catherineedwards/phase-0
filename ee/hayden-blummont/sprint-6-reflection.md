What did I do well this sprint?

I got through it a lot quicker than others and learned a more efficient ways to do things.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't do all the stretch things because I'm running low on time to do the other sprints.


What can I improve on next sprint?

Not get so caught up on one little thing for so long.
