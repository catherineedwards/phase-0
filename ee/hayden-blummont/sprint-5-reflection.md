 What did I do well this sprint?

 I spent a good amount of time on the content and asked for help earlier so I wasn't stuck as long on silly little things. I also spent more time on self-care and drank less booze.


 What didn't I do well this sprint?

 I didn't get through things as fast as I'd like.


 What can I improve on next sprint?

 I'm going to try find more time each day for it so I can get through in time for boot camp with what I need to know.
