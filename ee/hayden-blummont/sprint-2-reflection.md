What did I do well this sprint?

I asked for help when I needed it and boosted through stuff when I knew I had the energy.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't work very consistently and it made it harder to pick things back up.


What can I improve next sprint?

I can make sure I do at least a bit 4-5 days a week so I don't forget as much and don't slow myself quite as much as I have.
