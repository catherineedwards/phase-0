What did I do well this sprint?

I'm getting much better at the whole process over product thing and haven't been so caught up with perfecting my understandung of things.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't spend as much time as I'd have liked to on some of the stuff but figured it would be better to just keep on moving forward.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Faster faster faster xD
