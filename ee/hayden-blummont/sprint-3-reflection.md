What did I do well this sprint?

I got help when I needed it and moved on to other things when I was stuck.

What didn't I do well this week?

I didn't do enough self-care stuff and it was noticeable.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I could not get too caught up trying to understand everything 100%. I could also make sure I take care of myself better.
