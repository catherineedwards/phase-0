What did I do well in this Sprint?

I did this sprint a lot quicker than the previous ones as I think I was more focussed on process over product, and more willing to let imperfections slide.

What didn't I do well in this Sprint?

I found JavaScript REALLY HARD. The format of the Free Code Camp didn't really suit me as I didn't find much structure to it - just 110 different lessons! I learn much better when I can see the bigger picture on a subject and know how everything relates to each other. Jack has sent me a link to another JS tutorial which I've started and will tick away at in the background to increase my knowledge in this area.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Getting better at JS definitely.
