What did I do well in this Sprint?

I really like the site redesign I've done (despite a few little bugs!) and it made me really proud to produce something like that, and have it not only full responsive but designed for mobile first!

What didn't I do well in this Sprint?

TIME. MANAGEMENT. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

Not spending ages trying to fix every little bug or implement every little design feature I want - pick the achievable ones and roll out those!
