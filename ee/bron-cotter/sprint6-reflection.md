What did I do well in this Sprint?

Not giving up completely! 

What didn't I do well in this Sprint?

I found this Sprint to be the most challenging yet as I really struggled with the minesweeper game. The instructions seemed to go from being very clear and step by step to just "do the rest" which really lost me. I ended up looking at what other students had done and taking inspiration from that as well as doing extra study around JS on Codecademy and Eloquent. I still feel like I'm sinking slightly in a sea of unknown code!

What can I improve on next sprint?

Trying not to get so frustrated/depondant when I can't figure something out, working on my concentration, and using some more problem solving methods to help get me un-stuck
