What did I do well in this Sprint?

I enjoyed learning about grid-based design, it has made my page planning process that much better. I also enjoyed tidying my code and ensuring it follows best practices. I am also really enjoying reading Search Inside Yourself and learning more about Emotional Intelligence and Mindfulness Meditiation, two subjects I already had quite a keen interest in!

What didn't I do well in this Sprint?

Can't remember :)

What can I improve on next sprint?

Maintaining my meditation practise every day!
