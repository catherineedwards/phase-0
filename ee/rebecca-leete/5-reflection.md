<h3>SPRINT FIVE REFLECTION</h3>

<h5>What I did well</h5>
<p>
  Hmmmmm. I think I'm happy with the way I'm keeping to the *0% rule, even though it feels very unnatural, I really feel like it is going to all make sense further down the line. I'm also happy with the way I've reflected on my processes, and identified my approaches and mistakes for later learning.

<h5>What I didn't do well</h5>
<p>
  I got waaaay too stuck on the eloquent javascript chapter, spent like 2 hours just    reading it, let alone doing the exercises. I found it really helpful, but it did feel like a poor use of time. I also feel like I'm not utilising the problem-solving tools we've been given very well, as my current time constraints encourage me to just look at the answer rather than spend too much time working on an issue. So I'm getting through the work alright, but possibly not taking in as much as I could. I also had a really rough week personally and found it incredibly hard to focus :(

<h5>What to improve on</h5>
<p>
  I really want to be more aware of my timeboxing, I think it would be helpful in terms of actually seeing how long I am spending on things, maintaining focus, and staying on schedule. I want to persevere more with problems before giving up and finding the answer elsewhere, because I feel like I'm inhibiting my own chance to learn in neglecting this.
