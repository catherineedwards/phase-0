<h4>SPRINT 3 REFLECTION</h4>
  <strong>What I did well</strong>
  <p>
    Sprint 3 was cool. It's amazing to see that how far I've come since two sprints ago. I really enjoyed redesigning my website, and felt like I grasped all the concepts well enough to tackle it with confidence. I'm really happy with how my website has turned out, and really enjoyed pairing with fellow students and friends. I'm especially happy with how I time-boxed myself, and look forward to maintaining and even improving that through the next sprints.
  </p>
  <strong>What I didn't do well</strong>
  <p>
    I found it hard to follow the "process over product" idea, it's so hard to see what you want in my head and let go of that in favour of best practices. So I think my code is a bit messy, lots of covering stuff up because I didn't understand how to fix it in the first place. I also feel like I wasn't able to implement as many features of my wishlist as I would have liked. 
    <ol>
      <li>Because I never really saved my wishlist anywhere, durrrr</li>
      <il>Because I chose things that I just didn't have time to dig into. My eyes are always too big for my stomach. Or, fingers..?
    </ol>
  </p>
  <strong>What I can improve on next time</strong>
  <p>
    Definitely paying more attention to process. I also want to pair more, because it makes suuuch a difference to my learning and information processing. I think maybe it'd be worth keeping project ideas simpler too, I think that can really help my time-management, and give me more of an opportunity to master the basics and rely less on google.
