Sprint 1 Reflection!
<p>
Ok, well it feels great to have finally finished a sprint, given I started all the way back in September! I spent such a long time worrying greatly that I wasn't competent enough to succeed at this course, so it feels really <em>right</em> to reboot myself with much more social and mental space to focus on this course the way I want to be able to.

I'm really happy with the way I engaged with EDA staff and fellow students, and look forward to continuing those relationships in a really positive way.<br>I also really enjoy seeing the progress I'm making with touch typing, and hope this trend continues.<br>The third thing I feel I did well was to take clear and concise notes, which I draw on everyday and have been really valuable.

It still took me, damn, three weeks to go through sprint 1, but when I look at my toggl it only took me about 13 hours to get through everything with a reasonable amount of thoroughness. So I feel like there's room for improvement in concentrating my study time. I also haven't made any of the group check-ins yet, which I am openly disappointed about, and have set aside time to do one tomorrow morning, all things going well. I've also noticed a fair bit of insecurity around asking for help - I think I'm just worried I'm going to ask stupid questions, which I <em>know</em> doesn't need to be a problem, but it's there nonetheless.

I feel like I've finished sprint 1 with a lot of momentum, and I would like to carry that with me into the next sprint, and see if I can get through most of it in the space of a week. I want to get involved with the group check-ins for sure, and also increase the amount of time I spend studying/hanging out with other students. I would like to decrease the amount of time I spend fumbling through blocks on my own, because that takes up a lot of my time, and work on feeling comfortable with tabling things and coming back to them in an hour or a day. Otherwise I will just see where the course takes me next!
