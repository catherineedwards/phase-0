<h3>SPRINT 4 REFLECTION</h3>
<h5>What I did well</h5>
<p>
  I feel like I time-boxed myself well and completed everything in a reasonable time. This is probably the most important thing to me at the moment as we are now counting down til bootcamp. I also feel like I maintained a good balance of taking in 80% of the content and letting go of that last golden 20%. We'll see how that plays out later! I took good notes and feel like I am getting into the swing of working agilely and reflecting on my work methods and habits. I'm really enjoying the mindfulness aspect and find it easy to incorporate into other areas of my life.

<h5>What I didn't do well</h5>
<p>
  Well, during the Javascript lessons in freeCodeCamp, I managed to "waste" 4 hours by accidentally starting halfway through the list of challenges instead of at the start, and feeling suuuper blocked and confused, urgghh. But it was ok, it meant I got to revise over them as I went through from the start. I still don't feel like I have a very solid grasp on any of it, but I got from a to b at least.

<h5>What to improve next time</h5>
<p>
  Well, I definitely want to continue exercising mindfulness consistently, and I want to build the habit of observing and reflecting on and improving my work and study habits, as I feel like that can be one of the base factors of my productivity. I want to keep an eye on my productivity, and definitely pair more - I did this whole sprint without a single piece of advice from anyone.
