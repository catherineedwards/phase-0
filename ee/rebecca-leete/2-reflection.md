<h3>SPRINT 2 REFLECTION</h3><br>

<h4>What I did well</h4>
Woooooo!! Finished! This one took me ages, but considering Sprint 1 took me like 5 months to do, this is a definite improvement. I'm getting happier and happier with the time I'm committing to study, and am definitely noticing a big increase in motivation and momentum. I'm happy with my note-taking process, and the way I'm checking in with fellow students, and am especialy happy with the way I'm time-boxing my study. I have found a huge improvement in focus and productivity as a result of following the pomodoro structure

<h4>What I didn't do well</h4>
I think I'm still spending too much time trying to muscle through things on my own where I could easily ask for help. I spent some time this week working through some of my problems with an experienced programmer and he pointed out a whole lot of basic practices that I hadn't gotten quite right, so I think it's really important to pair with someone at least once a week, and to make sure I'm paying attention to getting the basics right so it doens't come back and bite me later. Also I keep missing check-ins. Like E V E R Y T I M E .

<h4>What I can improve on</h4>
I want to be spending more time studying and I also really want to get my head around layouts and css, because there's still a whole lot that's not quite working for me in there yet.
