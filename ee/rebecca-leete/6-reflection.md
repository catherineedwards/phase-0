<h3>SPRINT SIX REFLECTION</h3>
<h5>What I did well</h5>
<p>
  I worked fast! Yay! There were definitely stretches of very unfocussed time, but I felt like when I was focussed I was using my time really well - am blitzing through the blog posts now, and developing more of a streamlined process of taking in information, so that feels good. I did some good rubber ducking with stanley on the minesweeper thing, and that was really cool to help me gain an in-depth understand ing of what I was doing.

<h5>What I didn't do well</h5>
<p>
  Sooooooo unfocussed. Spent a lot of time procrastinating. I also feel like I cheated a little bit by looking at other versions of the minesweeper game that fellow students had finished already, when I was stuck. And I didn't do any of the stretch goals. That's probably what feels the worst.

<h5>What to improve on next time</h5>
<p>
  Mmmm, focus and motivation. I've temporarily misplaced my discipline to keep up with the pomodoro method, which was working really well for me. And other life things are feeling really attractively distracting at the moment. So maybe taking some time to recenter and connect with my motivation for doing this course, what I want to achieve and how i want to achieve it.
