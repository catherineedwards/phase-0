<h3>SPRINT 7 REFLECTION</h3>
<h5>What I did well<h5>
<p>
  Yay! I solved some stuff all by myself!! Slowwwwly beginning to gain confidence in my own coding abilities as I worked through some of the problems without any external reference, so it felt really good be able to rely on my own problem-solving resources. I also feel like I did a good job of acknowledging when it was time for me to take breaks so I could maintain optimal focus in the long run.

<h5>What I didn't do well</h5>
<p>
  Uhhhhhhh... I felt really bad about how lowly I worked through the free code camp exercises. It took me 5 hours to do six exercises. I think my toggl might be off, because that so doesn't feel right. And even doing them so slowly, I still felt like my understanding wasn't 100%, or in any way independent of looking at the answers.  Also, full disclosure, I got minimal study done this weekend because I was partying, so that felt like a divergence from my priorities that I want to understand more.
</p>
<h5>What to improve for next time</h5>
<p>
  I feel like I tackled tis sprint in a level-headed and well-balanced way, and look forward to continuing this approach through the next sprints.
