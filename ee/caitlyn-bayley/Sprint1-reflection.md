What did I do well in this sprint?
I found this sprint to be very challenging at times.  I have learnt so much over the course of it! I did well to overcome feelings of frustration and isolation, to know when to reach out.  It has changed my expectations of the course and I think I have done well to challenge those assumptions I had going in to Sprint 1.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think I spent too much time on problems as they came up.  I would dwell on very specific issues and feel trapped. I felt like I wasn't as good as other members of my cohort who seemed to be posting a lot and moving quickly.
What can I improve on next sprint?
I would like to manage my time better.  I would like to accept there are blocks and know I have the skills to work them out.  I would like to spend more time in the next sprint on campus and communicating with other cohort members as I move through it.
