 What did I do well this sprint?
 I feel like my time management was a lot better through this sprint obviously because I'm under time pressure but I feel like a understood a reasonable amount of this course work.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
Still struggling to get my head around general JavaScripting and formating. Something I will have to revise on the most going into Boot Camp.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Javascript in general. Understanding the process over product.
