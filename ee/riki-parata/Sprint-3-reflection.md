 Sprint 3 Reflection
 
 
 What did I do well this sprint?
Redesigning my website I feel as though I did will using the idea of "process over
product. I really focused on the simple functionality of my website oppose to making it
look amazing with sub par usability.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
With this focus on fuctionality there was opportunities for me to not try as many crazy ideas, 
looks and functions as I wanted. I guess this is something I can experiment more with learning
Javascript.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Again time management has been poor. Still trying to find my flow but been getting a wee bit 
 overwhelmed in recent times with life in general.
