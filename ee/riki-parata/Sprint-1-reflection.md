<h1>Sprint Reflection</h1>

 What did I do well this sprint?

In this sprint, I feel like I've really excelled in the HTML and CSS editing. I had done most of my previous coding with both HTML and CSS so I felt like I was reasonably at home and knew what I was doing. I also felt that from day to day I was getting more comfortable using the Command Line. It was something that I really wasn't looking forward to using because it was completely foreign to me! But now I think I'm starting to get a basic understanding of it.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I felt like I really struggled understanding how to communicate between the Command Line and Github. I felt as though all of my blockers that I experienced during this sprint were a direct cause of my lack of knowledge or understanding about the various git commands. Luckily this is all solvable by reading through resources given to me and also watching Youtube tutorials. I feel by watching and following along with video tutorials helps me learn and understand a lot more effectively.

What can I improve on next sprint?

This one is easy, time management. Probably one of the most important skills to have during this course and a skill that I'll definitely need to master to be a developer, managing my time needs improvement. It wasn't that I was disinterested in the task at hand because I definitely wasn't! I think what happened was I would hit a blocker, try and work it out for about an hour, say I'll have a break and come back, and leave it to long. A solution to this, instead of spending lots of time trying to fix it myself is be using my resources. First, go 100% on Google search and Github resources to find the answer and if I still can't figure it out, ask for help on Slack.
