    <h1>Sprint 2 Reflection</h1>
    <h2>What did I do well in this sprint?<h2> 
    <p>
       I felt I did well in the Udacity tutorials and followed the instuctions 
       correctly. The video, followed by an activity and then a quiz ensured that 
       I understood what I was learning.
    </p>
    <h2>What didn't I do well in this sprint?</h2>
    <p>
       I struggled a bit to understand the tidying tree. A similar feeling I had 
       when I was learning to use aGithub. It is something I will look beck over. 
       Also wondering what the "div" characteristic is. I feel like I should know what it 
       is and how to use it.
    </p>
    <h2>What can I improve on next sprint?</h2>
    <p>
       I want to continue improving the tidyness of my code using correct format so that my code is
       easy to read. I also need to improve on time management as I have really been unbalanced this week.
