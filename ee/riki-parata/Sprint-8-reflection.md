What did I do well this sprint?
One thing I thought I did well in this Sprint was identifying mistakes in my code. It got hard at points wondering why my calculator couldn't calculate problems but it was worth it in the end when I finally found the mistake (noramlly missing semi colons)

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I felt a wee bit out of my depth during this sprint as I was constantly using Google or provided hint through most of the calculating code process.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
Tidyness of code.
