 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I really enjoyed making my own blog and I think I was pretty successful, I am forever changing it and modifying it.

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Really making sure I understand what I'm learning, not ust trying to finish the assignment.

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
 I think one of the most important things I've learnt in Phase 0 is mindfullness and how it can help us in every aspect of our lives. I look forward to experimenting with it further.
