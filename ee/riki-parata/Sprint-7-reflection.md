What did I do well this sprint? What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think the basic understanding is their but I get confused and somethings lack confidence when the JavaScript algorithms get a bit more complex. I think my time management was better. I found myself needing a lot of hints as I just couldn't get my head around some of the challenges.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Working periods, focusing and working for a set amount of time, breaking, then repeating. This will ensure I am efficent, take everything I learn in, and not wasting my time.
