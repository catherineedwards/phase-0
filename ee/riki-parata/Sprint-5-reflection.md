 What did I do well this sprint?
I felt really motivated in this Sprint, I felt as though I was understanding more in this assignment because it was tailored to my way of learning a bit more. I really thrive when I can see an action performed and then perform the action myself and apply it to similar situations.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
Still getting used to formating Javascript functions, arrays, loops etc and finding my little mistakes. A lot of these skills will improve as I keep moving on.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 This has probably been my best performance in a sprint for a while. Just not rushing but also not wasting time, making sure I understand everything I'm doing
