What did I do well this sprint?
I time boxed very well and through this I almost completed the sprint in one week. I managed to not get bogged or distracted by minor detail. Instead I focused on the learning rather then the outcomes or more specifically how my site looked.

What could I have done to improve?
I stuggled reading through the Search Inside Youself chapter again. I managed to start but then it was very slow. I found that my concentration wavered again and again. Ironic considering what I was trying to read about meditation and how it can help things like concentration. I think I may need to get the book onto my phone or even purchase a hard copy. If I had more time I would have liked to add more detail to my wireframe and boxifying.
