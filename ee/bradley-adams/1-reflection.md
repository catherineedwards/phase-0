Why is reflection important?
There seems to be a big link between reflection and learning. If we reflect we further our learning. When looking back you can looked at what work and what didn't. Reflection can provide incremental improvements based on your experiences. If we don't reflect on bad experiences then we can start associating them with the wrong outcomes. Learning topics comes with reflection as you can look at either sides rather then just knowing what it is or does.

What did I do well this week?
I am on track to finish my first sprint this week. I asked for some help in a few areas which help save a lot of time. Maybe next time I wont leave it as long as I did.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to try clear some more time. I have been working about what I thought I could but its often interrupted by work and other things. I have found it hard to get back into sections and spending time away. I need to keep some consistency in goals I am setting. The 4 questions about reflection should help with this. I feel myself letting some time leak out because of a bad state of mind. Consistent meditation can clear some thoughts that just done need to be there.
