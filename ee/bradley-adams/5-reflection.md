What did I do well this sprint?
I thought I go through the reading well. Took it in and started to make sense of how Javascript all works in together. I thought I got into some study on different days where the motivation was a little well so im pround of that.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
The last section about getting the totals to work did go well. It took a lot of research to get everything sorted. I am stuggle with the sort of short form loop. Hard for me to grasp the idea around the conters for example. After getting to a result I could sort of work backwards from there. But getting to the result was a lot of trial and error.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I think working through the problem solving meathods a bit closer is a good idea. Going to start journaling. I think I will end up spending some more time on this sprint to work through the Java in more detail. I may have rushed this one a bit.
