What did I do well this sprint?
I went in to the EDA offices twice and got quite a lot done. I also meet a couple of other people attending my cohort. I almost got all of the sprint done in 1 week.  

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I had some down days which I could have really used to get ahead. Especially considering I didnt get much don the start of this week due to some sickness.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I think getting my body right then spending some big days on the content would be great. Targeting this weekend Saturday and Sunday to do some real damage to sprint 8. I thinking staying in the motions for long periods will do me some good. I'm thinkinh some big days are a good idea.
