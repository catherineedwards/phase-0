What did I do well this week?
It was well this sprint took me quite a while to complete. I have been tied up with a lot of things outside of study so some days I was only getting about 30mins to work on the sprint work. However I and quite happy that I did keep going rather then putting it on the back burner until next year. I thought I picked up the grid stucture concept quite well and I also thought bootstrap worked well. I can see how I would benifit from these.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to be able to let a few of the little things go. Getting hung up on small learnings that arent working are costing me a lot of time. I should spend some more time learning about git and github. I spent a lot of time around the pull requests. The Emotional Intelligence section was a bit of a stuggle for me. I found the book quite hard to read. It felt like I was back at university have to re read things over and over becuase I couldn't make sense of them on the first try. I went back and tried to find the video mentioned but couldnt find anything. Tried a couple of things that may help including the speaking option on my mac. Then just following along with the reading.
