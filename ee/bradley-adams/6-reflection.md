What did I do well this sprint?
I got thorugh 2 stretch goals which took a long time but I learn't a lot in the process. I dicovered more then one way to get through some tasks. I also got some understanding around how this process is meant to challenege me and that I'm not going to get through all of it perfectly. This was probably the first real sprint that challeneged me in terms of not just throwing time at it to get a solution.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I took a long to complete the work. I did not time box well or keep to time slot allocated for some study. I did finished the sprint off well and how I planned to but the start was a long winded process where I got a little overwhelmed.  

What can I improve on next sprint?
This is my last week at work so I'm going to try spend more time in the Dev offices. I went in for a few hours last week and it went very well. Concentration was up and a few classmates to talk to was great for the head. I also have a very clear plan about a sprint per week for the next 3 weeks. Ideally I would like to get through 3 sprints in 2 weeks and a week spare but at this stage it doesnt look likely as I am away this weekend.
