What did I do well this sprint?
    -the programming concepts were all quite straight forward and easy to understand.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    -cleaning up the comments and putting in new ones was a bit lacklustre/skipped. With more complex tasks not properly explaining the code would lead to a big headache when debugging.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    -Time management and allocation could always be improved to help accommodate the less direct aspect such as comments.
