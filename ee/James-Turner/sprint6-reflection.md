What did I do well this sprint?
    -Accomplishing the working minesweeper game was relatively smooth with few blockages in progressing.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    -I couldn't think of too many alterations or additional aspects to add to the minesweeper game so it was left fairly bare bones.
    -My commenting of code sections was also lacking.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    -Try get in a more creative mindset with more of an aim for what can be done rather than a narrow how to get this done.
