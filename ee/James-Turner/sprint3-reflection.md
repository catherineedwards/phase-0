What did I do well this sprint?
    -The framework was straight forward to understand and impliment.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
    -Got a bit hung up on the design not really in a perfectionist way but in a lacking in ideas way.
    -The acsseability of the design was not fully explored. Not sure what experience a visually impared person would have with it.

What can I improve on next sprint?
    -Allow myself to skip something with the intent of going back to it later rather than trying to get it all done in order.
    -Possibly not the next sprint but the next desing based one would be to get a better feel of colour choices that compliment or provide good contrast.
