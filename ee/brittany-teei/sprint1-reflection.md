Thoughts so far...

What did I do well in this sprint?
            
The thing that I did best this sprint was allowing myself time to get into the swing of beginning the coruse without stressing too much about the difficulties that I have faced. There have been moments when I really felt that I am crazy for embarking on this journey at this point in my life, but now that I am at this stage doing the reflection I am feeling good about it.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I wasn't very good with understanding the terminals and command lines. I am really glad that I made it over this hurdle because it was really making me feel bad about my abilities. I was thinking things like "if I can't work out the basics-then there's no hope for me!

What can I improve on next sprint?

I can dedicate more time to sit and go through the extra resources so that I can build my capabilities, comprehension and confidence.
