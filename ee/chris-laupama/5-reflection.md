What did I do well this sprint?
- I feel pretty happy that I completed this sprint in a decent amount of time.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- Hmmmm... I'm not too sure here... I think starting to use the speech function to read the book was a bad idea, so I switched back to reading it myself, the robot voice didn't work so well for me lol.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- Hmmmm I think utilising more resources when I come to an issue/problem.
