What did I do well this sprint?
- I think I did well at looking over how certain things were done, I felt like it was easy to read others code and understand the concept.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I think I spread things out a little, rather than doing it all in one big sprint. I kept on going back to previous sections of the sprint, so maybe focusing a little more on one concept at a time rather than jumping around. I also spent a tonne of time on certain areas, even though I understood the concept, I kept on trying to memorise it... which ended up being a bad decision as I kept on certain parts far too long.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- I think looking for help more is probably a good start and also to keep moving along rather than just sitting on one part of the sprint for too long.
