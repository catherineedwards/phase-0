What did I do well this sprint?
- I think that I did reasonably well with the shorter amount of time I allocated myself to complete this sprint.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I didn't allocate enough time for this sprint, I also started it... 3 or 4 weeks ago and then completed it in one day. It certainly made the recapping on the HTML and CSS side of things difficult, but I got through it.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- I think now that I've stopped work I will be able to complete my sprints in a more effective manner. So I think just taking the time to understand them and hold the information is where I could improve.
