What did I do well this sprint?
- I think spending a decent amount of time trying to figure out the answers was probably where I did well... the tutorial we went through was pretty horrible, so I had to source the web to help me understand the concept and come up with a solution.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I think at times I spent quite a lot of time (maybe too much) trying to find a solution, the reason why is because I wanted to understand the concept.. so there was a couple I had to skip in order to progress.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- I think at times I need to block out times dedicated to specific things in order to not over do it and spend too much time on one thing.
