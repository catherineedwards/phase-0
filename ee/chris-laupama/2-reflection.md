What did I do well this sprint?
- I think I managed my time really well this sprint. I managed to get to a point where I'm happy with my current progress, however I do feel like I could be completing things a bit faster, it's just that I like delving into more information on the new topics/subjects I learn. I also was really stoked that I learn about bootstrap, I became hugely excited to use it... then I learnt more about CSS Grid and how it is probably a much better solution rather than relying on something like bootstrap or another framework.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- Hmmmm, I think the "pay off some technical debt" part is something I'll need to recap on as I can see that most students aren't posting their links to their pull requests in the channel... so it made it difficult for me to complete 2.5.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- I think I could probably... spend more time revising some sections that felt a little over my head, I know I will in the future, but so far I'm feeling really confident in my progress and capabilities.
