What did I do well this sprint?
- I think I strengthened my reading ability of JS this sprint. There were times I couldn't understand where to start but I was able to look at other pieces of peoples codes and ready them pretty sweet.

I also took on board a good lot of information around functions, I just look forward to having more practice using them.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
- I think holding the information is still something I'm struggling with, so I'm utilising time outside of the sprint to go over the concepts again.

What can I improve on next sprint?
- I think just having more practice time is something that is key for me at this stage. More time to repeatedly go over the concepts.
