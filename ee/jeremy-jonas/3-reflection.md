What did I do well this sprint?
I was able to use the skeleton CSS to create a beter looking website that I am happy with.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
This sprint took me a long time due to the design aspect of it. I need to work on not getting stuck on minor details

What can I improve on next sprint?
Aiming to get the sprint completed faster rather than spending too much time on little details.
