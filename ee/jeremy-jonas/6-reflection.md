What did I do well this sprint?
I was able to work through the issues I was having with the counter function of the minesweeper game by reaching out to one of my friends and he helped me find the error in my code.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I am happy with the progress I made with this sprint and how I was able to oversome the problems.

What can I improve on next sprint?
With 2 weeks until bootcamp I would like to ensure that I stay on track and do a little less gaming :)
