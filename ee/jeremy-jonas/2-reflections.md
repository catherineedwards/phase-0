What did I do well this sprint?
I was able to learn how github worked and it has set me up for proceeding through the following sprints easily when it comes to the github related stuff.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I took too long to get the pull request approved and approve someone else's.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I'd like to try and minimise the distractions at home to help keep my focus strong.
