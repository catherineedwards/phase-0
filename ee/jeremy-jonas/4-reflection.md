What did I do well this sprint?
I was able to complete the sprint in a good amount of time.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think this sprint actually went really well so I can't think of anything this time.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I'd like to cut down even more on the time it takes to complete due to the speed bootcamp start date is approaching.
