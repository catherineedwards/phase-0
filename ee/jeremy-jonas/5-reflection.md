What did I do well this sprint?
When I got stuck on something, after trying to solve it myself I reached out for help and was able to use the information provided to solve the problem.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Once again I think this sprint went really well so I can't think of anything this time.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I'd like to try and minimise the distractions at home to help keep my focus strong.
