What did I do well this sprint?
I got through the sprint in an acceptable amount of time despite the challenges and also the external influences which were causing a big disruption to my studies this week.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
The free code camp exercises, mostly due to things not working and not understanding the requirements of a couple of the exercises.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I am planning to work in a pair with nother member of my cohort on the calculator challenge so I am hoping this will give me a chance to assess and possibly improve on my teamwork skills.
