What did I do well this sprint?
At the times when I became stuck or something wasn't working, I was able to find answers and solutions to my questions and problems by myself.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think it took me longer to complete than it should have, so time management is probably what I didn't do well this sprint.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Definitely time management would be the number 1 thing for my to improve on.
