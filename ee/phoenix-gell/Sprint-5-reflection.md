 What did i do well this sprint?

i think i did reasonably well at trying different strategies however i find alot of this incredibly hard to understand and i may need to catch up alot during the bootcamp and pair up with others.

What didnt i do well with this sprint?

managing myself i used up alot of time trying to learn that i pushed myself out of time management and forced myself behind schedule, i'll have to find my tutors and others in order to help learn and keep up with everyone.

I will make sure to take breathers more and focus on what i need to learn during my assessment completion time.
