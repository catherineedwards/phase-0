What did I do well this sprint?
Redesigning went really well but as it always is was time consuming but in saying that also enjoyable 
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 Definately the Skeleton files , I never came to the conclusion as to why it changed my code on first try but i found ways around it and built on that.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 My ability to make my columns contain less space that is not required not enough to make the website jumbled but enough to keep everything together.
