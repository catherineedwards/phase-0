
What did i do well this sprint 

Im pretty Proud of myself to have the minesweeper take completed this sprint. Lots of this was extremely frustrating and i found myself asking alot of others and madly searching google for answers on what to do next. Finally after many all nighters i finished it and got things to work for me.

What didnt i do well this sprint?

I relied too much on google although im running out of time to complete my assignments i realise that i shouldnt rely on google and others as much as i have and instead try to myself learn the code a little more so that i can trial and error.

What can i improove on next sprint?
Not giving myself too much criticism and push on even when i may be a little frustrated and start to procrastinate and i need to understand there is always more to learn and its impossible to know everything.
