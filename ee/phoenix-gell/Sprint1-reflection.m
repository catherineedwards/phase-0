What did I do well this sprint?
TO be honest with myself i lvoed coding , getting around github was a struggle and a half as its a new program and using windows can be an obstacle rather than a clear path if you dont do some study beforehand 
, however in saying that i belive going through the obstacle and using it (windows) i was able to gain a better understanding.. 
In short Html was a great way to learn to be creative using a new language and as you begin to work on your website(s) your vocabulary expands dramaticly and everythign else becomes so much more fun when the things you find hard are finally easy.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 hmm ...Definately github and repositories as i mentioned above it became hard to udnerstand alot of the theory behind the push and pull comands but this isnt a solid issue for other users it happens depending on what Terminal Manufacturer you are using 
 however if anyone reading this ever needs help with Windows i am more than happy to go over it with you and lend a hand :)

 What can I improve on next sprint?
definately my time management.. not that im procrastinating, i found myself often wanting to push through something i could not and instead of moving around it and caming back i stopped and spent 
alot of time that i didnt need to on researching how to complete my current task. I think i should try move aorund the task im stuck on this coming sprint and move along to the next one if available and tlak to more pairs 
more through Slack Communications..
