What did I do well this sprint?

Deifnately with column's i believe this was the easiest to play around with..
i also enjoyed cleanign up my websites although theyre still quite messy i have been able to slowly make progress on it and that in turn makes it easier to read and write.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

The Branch 'Tidying' i still dont understand how this works and im not sure if i ever will.. To do all the work and delete it in the end hurts the most as well.
Another was boxing as much as it was exciting it was also pretty hard to udnerstand and the materials in udacity did'nt work for me so that complicated things just as well.

What can I improve on next sprint?

My attention to detail. Although im rushing to get my sprints finished as i have fallen behind slightly i should focus on keepign my code tidy and maybe getting someone to read over my spelling msitakes (a fresh pair of eyes is the best pair of eyes right?)
