- What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I think that I really tried my hardest, really. Even if there are still a lot of things that I don't fully understand and that I have a lot to work through, I can't wait to start with the Bootcamp.

- What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I could have focused a bit harder on maximising my learning, and I definitely could have timeboxed a bit better throughout the last couple of sprints.

- What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

Meditation, definitely, as well as timeboxing (not perfectly) and the basics of all the skills that I will need for Bootcamp.
