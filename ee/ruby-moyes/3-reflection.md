- What did I do well this sprint?

I thought I did well at the planning and execution of putting my wireframe into HTML and CSS using Skeleton, which was super helpful and really helped me plan for what was possible. I thought I also did well at making sure that I followed a process in my head and on paper, which helped me stay on track for completing everything in a time frame I thought was acceptable.

-What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't do well at relaxing. I was so anxious about the sprint that I missed heaps of steps and had to backtrack to get extra information. Even now, I am pretty worried that I've missed really important steps that I just can't see.

-What can I improve on next sprint?

Relaxing, breathing, learning to accept that I'm going to make mistakes while learning all these new, difficult things.
