- What did I do well this sprint?
Making sure that I was always learning something. Making sure that when I didn't solve a problem and had to look for the solution, I looked over the code that was given and made notes about why that code worked and why mine didn't.


- What didn't I do well this sprint?
Spending more time on each solution, using my resources properly, making sure I knew why I was making the choices I was making.


- What can I improve on next sprint?
More meditation, more mindfulness, more self-confidence. Spending more time on getting help and helping myself, taking a moment to recollect and relax, instead of focusing on the problems I can't solve.
