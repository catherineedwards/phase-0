- What did I do well this sprint?
 I think I did well with solving problems with backtracking, and using my time to learn instead of being distracted and letting frustration overtake me.


- What didn't I do well this sprint?
  I think that I didn't do well with trial and error. I didn't allow myself enough time to fail enough times to learn the hard way, and took the easy way out each time I couldn't solve a problem.

- What can I improve on next sprint?
  I can improve on making sure that I take the time to try things before giving up and looking at the solutions. I think that I can definitely try harder.
