- What did I do well this sprint?

Taking my time and researching problems instead of rage quitting and saying GG. I also felt like I made some progress in learning JS, even though there are still massive gaps in my knowledge. I definitely knew more than when I started, and I suppose that's all I can do for now.

- What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't do well with tempering my patience, and often gave in to the easier path. A lot of times I didn't wait to solve a problem myself, but rather just went to the solution and worked my way back to the problem. This did let me learn a lot more with a lot less pain, and I took heaps and heaps of notes that I can refer back to when I need them, but I think that I could have tried harder to problem solve on my own.

- What can I improve on next sprint?

My patience, definitely. Also my timeboxing still needs work.
