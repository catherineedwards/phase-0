What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
    
    I did well in focusing on process over product. I kept a great pace and I didn't let myself get too stuck on things. I used my time well and was diligent in my work. 

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

    Rather than taking an entire month of while in America, I should have spent a little bit of time each week to stay fresh. 

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

    Strengthened my meditation practice, I have become excellent at prioritising, and good at not getting hung up on small details.
