What did I do well this sprint?
I had fun playing with everything in order to learn.  Not getting frustrated with skeleton docs and just moving forward building from scratch.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I stalled my progress and undid a lot of work through the command line all because I forgot to create a repo.  Lost a whole day of wrestling with the command line over something so simple.  At least I was laughing at myself when I eventually figured it out.  And learnt a whole lot in the process.
What can I improve on next sprint?
I will meditate every day and stop being lazy in this area.
