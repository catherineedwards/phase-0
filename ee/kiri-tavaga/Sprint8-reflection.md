What didn't I do well this sprint?
I found the loving kindness practice exercise difficult.  I find it too airy fairy and think it's due to the way I'm wired.  I find demonstrating the practice with actions to be more in line with my love language.
What can I improve on?
I am looking forward to fixing up my website and learning more through play in this last sprint.
