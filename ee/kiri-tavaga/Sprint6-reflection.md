What did I do well this sprint?
I researched, recorded when required and persisted when I was stuck.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
Take a break :-) I know I'm going away for four days and wanted to earn my break so worked solid while I could.
What can I improve on next sprint?
I need more practice at javascript - still don't have it nailed yet.
