What did I do well this sprint?
I took my time absorbing as much of the information as possible.  I found that I needed to write information down when it was difficult just so I could work out the process in my head (on paper) before applying it on free code camp exercises.
What didn't I do well this Sprint?
I couldn't figure out how to truncate a string and spent too long on the exercise before moving on.
What can I improve on next sprint?
I'm looking forward to more debugging practice and applying the new learnings to my website as there is a lot to fix.
