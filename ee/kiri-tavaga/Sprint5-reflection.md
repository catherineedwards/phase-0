What did I do well this sprint?
I didn't write any information down to see how I went with the learning.  I know I'm missing information that I would have naturally retained if I had written it down but managing to still navigate through the tasks with the knowledge gained so far worked ok and was faster.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I made the same mistake on the command line of not cloning the repo correctly in the right order which set me back a bit till I was able to ammend it.
What can I improve on next sprint?
Finding a good balance of written learning and winging it.
