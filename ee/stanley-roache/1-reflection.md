How well did I do this sprint?

I think I did pretty well. I made progress familiarising myself with the toolset and workflow that I will use for the bootcamp.

I started my website. It's pretty basic at the moment but I'll continue to style it with CSS.

Though intially there was quite a flood of new information I was able to relax and absorb it at my own pace.

I spent quite a bit of time digesting the ideas and reading material presented and feel like I formed a solid sense of them in my own mind, this provoked subtle new ways of looking at things.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I think I struggled with the timeboxing. When I set aside an hour for reading I suddenly felt rushed, like it was a race. I want to timebox in a way that goes set time, work at my own pace until timer goes, stop and review.

I felt like I rushed in general a bit at the start, out of feeling uncertain what to do and how to do it.

I also went through the sprint quite quickly, this isn't a problem in itself but throughout phase0 if I find myself mastering something quickly I want to explore it more deeply, make my own elaborations to the learning and include this in the timesheet.

What can I improve on next sprint?

More connection with the phase 0 group! I want to be working on my stuff more in tandem and bounce of people more. It makes sense this early on that I don't have that connectionwell developed yet, I can certainly continue to grow it next sprint.

Keep practicing good time, focus and intention habits.
