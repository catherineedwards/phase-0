What did I do well in this sprint?

I allocated the time I would be working on the material effectively. At points where I got stuck or was trying to tackle too many things at once I was able to pare down my focus and procede with the task, sometimes this meant leaving details for later.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I felt a bit like I rushed through the design process.
At times I got bogged down in detail or felt stuck/stressed when my focus was spread over too many things at once.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I can still get better at time allocation. When I've allocated time for something I can get better at wiping everything else from my mind for that period, I still tend to look ahead and let thoughts that I need to speed up and get a result disturb my focus. If I can do this I know I'll be more relaxed and more focused.

I can get better at taking a pause and reminding myself that it doesn't matter all that much, this is a great release valve for any mental tension.
