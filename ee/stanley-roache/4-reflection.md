## What did I do well this sprint?

* This sprint I could ingest the material quite quickly, because it is somewhat familiar.
* I think I connected quite well with other members of the cohort. I made an effort whenthere was opportunity to share something that was on my mind. Making those offerings in a social context I think is crucial in letting me start to feel connected in a group.
* I managed my time OK.
* I got outside a lot. Makes a big difference.

## What didn't I do well/could I improve on?

* When I was deep in something I stopped taking good breaks, this let me keep steaming on for a little but tired me out. I can get better at taking strategic breaks that refresh without breaking focus when I'm on a roll.
* I concerned myself a little bit about what people might think of my writing, about where I stand in the group. I could find a way to let go of these social worries more.
