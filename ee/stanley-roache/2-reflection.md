What did I do well this sprint?

A couple of days I structured my time well. There were a few moments where I could tell my focus was drifting or a task was feeling undefined. Sometimes I didn't catch myself but sometimes I said - ok, do I refocus and continue or take a break? - and could break out of that state.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I let coding bleed a little into my personal time, on Sunday I worked on one of the blogs and the github assignment of merging branches. I expect to be working at times outside of working hours I've set myself on occassion, but this week didn't require that and I want that to be the exception, not the habit.

I know from experience I need a good separation of focused work and other parts of life or the stress can get high.

I didn't organise myself to make the video check in.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I can still improve on good time structure and habits for when I'm working and when putting work aside. Also being clear about what I'm working on in a given time slot and staying focussed.

I can also work on my connection with other phase-0er's
