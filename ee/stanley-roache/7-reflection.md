What did I do well this sprint?

I enjoyed and felt like I deeply absorbed the idea of functions as values in javascript, what this makes 
possible. It was technically really interesting. 


What could I improve on next sprint?

This sprint my enthusiasm and sense of mission in the assignments took a dive. What I can work on in these times is to take a pause and reflect on/reconnect with - why am I doing this? So it becomes engaging again. Also make sure I'm taking with other people about it, working alongside others, etc.
