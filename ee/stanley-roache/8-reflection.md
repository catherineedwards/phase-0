### What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint I pushed myself do implement extra features technically when I flet like I was already able to handle what was being asked. I also made sure that I took time to focus on the design of the caluclator I was building, this being my 'weak side' in the web dev suite of skills.

### What could I have improved on?

This sprint included a very long break from looking at code which partially I needed but also meant I lost a bit of momentum and clarity of purpose. I think this still comes from going thorugh phases where I push myself slightly too hard and don't incorporate enough real breaks and reminders to myself of why I'm doing the task at hand. I can improve on my working rhythm.
