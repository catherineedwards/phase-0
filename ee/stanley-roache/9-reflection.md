## What did I do well throughout phase 0?

I made sure I felt competenet with all the technical skills.

I stretched myself in the areas where I knew I already had some familiarity.

I made an effort to be touching base with others throughout the process.

I pushed myself to reflect thoroughly with the 'cultural blog' questions.

I made it clear when I was expecting myself to put effort in and when I was taking a break, avoiding mingling these.

## What could I have done better?

I think I could have been more consistent with my working pattern, I tended to go in bursts.

I could have put more attention into habit building, especially those suggested throughout the sprints. I think these are really valuable, I didn't put sustained effort into making them habitual.

I could have timeboxed and time managed more. Particularly when I was spending lots of time tinkering with things that really felt complete, or at least to the point where my effort was best spent elsewhere. It was kind of just procrastination.

Another thing was that at times where I would procrastinate, I didn't always take the time to reframe or break down exactly the thing that I was blocked on.

Though I did do this, I think I could get a whole lot more by asking myself at the outset of each new task, what is my mission here, questioning until I know exactly what I'm aiming for, and then always reflecting with that aim in mind. Often I leap into things without solidifying and resounding off that intention.

## What habits have I learned

Like I say, by my own measure I neglected this part a little bit. 

- I feel like I seek more to understand others, that's a habit that had been boosted a bit.
- I clarify to myself more often what I'm aiming to get done and how.
- I have been taking more time than I might usually to reflect on the learning process.
- I've eased off or tempered the pressure I normally place on myself. And in particular I seek the perspective of others when I'm stressed from too strict expectations, this lets me shed that mindset quite quickly and get perspective.
