## What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint I got super absorbed in some of the material which was great.
I think I set myself up for this by following my curiousity.

## What didn't I do well this sprint/ could I improve on?

When I was working on a game I got carried away and focused intensely for a period without taking many breaks, afterwards I pretty much disengaged for 5 days, this is OK but I'd rather keep a bit more of a steady rhythm.

I could manage my time and enthusiasm a bit better and leave myself hungry for more at the end of each day.

I let my communication with fellow phase-0-ers drop a bit.
