# What did I do well this sprint?

I gave myself good breaks. This sprint I was able to take the pressure off myself quite a lot. Enter intense periods of focus and then back off deliberately with a good rhythm.

I remembered to remove myself from the computer when I wasn't focusing.

# What didn't I do well/ Could I improve on

At some points I was wrestling with a problem and felt I could have gained a lot by stopping and drawing it out on paper or doing on of the other unsticking techniques earlier instead of attempting to push through it.

Just a little bit of an earlier recognition at stuck points and a bit more strategy around them.
