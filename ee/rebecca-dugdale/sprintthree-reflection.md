What did I do well this sprint?<br><br>
I kept positive through my frustrations and I was even able to help another of my cohorts which felt really good because if I can talk someone else through something I must be understanding it. <br><br>
What didn't I do well this sprint?<br><br>
I have to admit that I didn't do so great at remembering that the process was
more important than the product.  It's not that I don't believe it is, but I
am such a perfectionist that I just want to get everything right the first time.
I can't wait until I can get my pages to look exactly how I want them to and I
look at the things that I have done so far and know that in some ways it is a
big mess and should be done another way, but I will have to wait to fix all that.<br><br>
What can I improve on next sprint?<br><br>
My mindset around these things.  I have to keep reminding myself that it's ok not
to know everything and that every time I go back over something or read another
resource I am solidifying my knowledge and growing in understanding.
