What did I do well this sprint?<br>
I was proud of the way I kept going through the Minesweeper task this sprint.  I found lots of it really frustrating, in a good way - if being frustrated can be a good thing, but I was determined to get through it and was really proud of myself at the end.<br>
I'm also proud of the fact that I accepted my limitations.  I really, really, really wanted to change the colours of the numbers so that they were different for each number like in the original game but I tried for a really long time and got completely blocked and really didn't want to stop but I knew that I would just not keep going on my sprints and just sit there trying at this one thing if I didn't let it go.  So I told myself that I will continue, and there's no reason why I can't go back to it at a later date after I've learnt some more and see whether I can puzzle it out.<br><br>
 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
 What I didn't do so well on this sprint was the feeling I got about myself from giving up on this problem.  I know it's something that I am going to face over and over in my career in web development so I really had better get used to it but I did beat myself up a bit because I really thought I should have been able to think my way around the problem.<br><br>
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
 Not giving myself such a hard time for not knowing everything.  This is a learning process and if I knew everything already there'd be no need to learn and also there's ALWAYS going to be more to learn anyway which is half the fun so I just need to chill out a bit and let it be what it is and just focus on the fact that I have come a long way already.
