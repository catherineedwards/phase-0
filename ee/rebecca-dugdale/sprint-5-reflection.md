 What did I do well this sprint?<br><br>
 I think I did well at trying different strategies to manage the java problem solving activities.  I kept trying different methods until I found something that worked and so I felt pretty good when I was able to solve things. <br><br>
 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br><br>
 I didn't do so well at managing myself during those activities.  There were several points where I should have taken breaks but I was so determined to solve the problem once I started that I just stayed there going over it and trying new things until I got it.  That sort of behaviour isn't really sustainable because there are going to be situations in which I can't do that, and it's not healthy to do that either.<br><br>
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br><br>
 Making sure that I take breathers and do something away from the code and the screen every so often.
