What did I do well this sprint?<br><br>
I feel like I'm getting somewhere with JavaScript! Hurrah!! I felt like the exercises I had to do made more sense, I spent less time staring wondering how to start and more time problem solving the bits that didn't work from my original ideas.  I was able to google my ideas to find the exact code to help me achieve what I wanted and I feel really good about what I achieved.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br><br>
 As I was going through the tasks, I found that some of the ways I was solving problems were overly complicated and there were much better solutions presented when I checked answers afterwards so there is so much still to learn and I need to refine my understanding in all areas but I still feel good about where I am at the moment.

 What can I improve on next sprint?<br><br>
 Everything lol. The more I learn the more I realise there's more to learn so there is always something to improve.  I need to spend more time on revision but I have a lot of weeks left til the May bootcamp so I will have a lot of time to revise and try to extend myself.
