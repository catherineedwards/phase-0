What did I do well this sprint?
For me I feel perserverence with learning many new concepts was my strenght this sprint.
What I didn't do well this sprint?
Time management. I need to get a better balance of life and time to be able to stick to my schedule and complete my sprints and tasks in a more timely way. I do not want to fall further behind so will commit more time per day and week to catch up and get ahead.
What can I do to improve on the next sprint?
Ask the slack phase-0 group for help if I am stuck or blocked. I think pride gets in my way and I search to often for the answers on my own. Getting used to a group learning environment slowly so must try harder to ask for help.
