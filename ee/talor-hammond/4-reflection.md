 # What did I do well this sprint? #
Felt familiar with JavaScript coming from Swift (apart from the syntax), learning was comfortable (so far)

 # What didn't I do well this sprint? #
Wasn't as consistent with Toggl as I was during previous sprints

 # What can I improve on next sprint? #
Use Toggl more consistently :-)
