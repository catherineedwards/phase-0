 # What did I do well this sprint? #
 Pushed myself to solve the extended problems w minesweeper, left one or two, but learnt a lot about iterating through for loops to push data / properties

 # What didn't I do well this sprint? #
 Inconsistent w time, was a bit off / on this week w commitments. Hit a couple of road-blocks but managed to resolve / learn

 # What can I improve on next sprint? #
 Be more consistent with time-management :~)
