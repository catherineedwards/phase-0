## What did I do well this sprint? ##
Went comprehensively through the exercises; did a lot of reading of eloquent javascript, and found I learnt a lot through applying it

## What didn't I do well this sprint? ##
Was hard to get back into it at first after being away from any sort of code for 2 weeks, but gradually worked my way into it

## What can I improve on next sprint? ##
Look to debug before searching for the solution -- learnt a lot in one of the times I used it properly; good habit to get into
