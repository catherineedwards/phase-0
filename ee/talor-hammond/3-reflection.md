 # What did I do well this sprint? #
Went through Skeleton framework, and CSS material comprehensively --  learnt a lot in building website w little CSS nuances and such

 # What didn't I do well this sprint? #
Spent too much time on creating a "polished product" imo, need to not stress too much over how it looks at this stage

 # What can I improve on next sprint? #
Spend less time focussing on the product, rather than the process involved w learning
