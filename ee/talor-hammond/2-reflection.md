### What did I do well this sprint? ###
    * Went through and / practiced applied all the bootstrap methodology / documentation pretty thoroughly; might look to create a branch of my blog using the bootstrap framework for practice

### What didn't I do well this sprint? ###
    * Could definitely look to commit more often! Current habit means I look to finish a project to "completion" before committing anything; so should definitely look to be committing in more regular intervals

### What can I improve on next sprint? ###
    * Do more research into branching in git / GitHub! Ran into some obstacles w the "tidying" in this sprint, but solved through Googling / some StackOverflow
        * More reading and practice on branching will be sweet
