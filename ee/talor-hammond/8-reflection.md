# What did I do well this sprint? #
Focussed primarily on building a calculator that functions correctly, rather than stressing too much on design; was good for learning.
Managed time well, listening to music and coding at the same time was a good habit to get into


# What didn't I do well this sprint? #
Didn't run into too many issues, first time using branching w git in terminal for a while

# What can I improve on next sprint? #
Do some more reading on git branches
