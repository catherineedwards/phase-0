 What did I do well this sprint?

 I took my time going through all the exercises. I tried to draw out ideas for things that are more complicated to make things easier. I also attempted to talk other people through my code as I was creating it. It is quite hard to explain to others what's going through my head at the time without it sounding like ramblings.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

 I think this sprint went quite well but timekeeping was a bit chaotic yet again.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

 I definitely want to improve on the sketching out process. It should help with more complicated projects along the line which can't be solved in the head.
