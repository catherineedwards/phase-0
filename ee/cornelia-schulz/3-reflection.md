What did I do well this sprint?

My time management definitely improved. I think I found a proper rhythm to encorporate study and work without getting too stressed out. So yay to that.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I loved the re-designing exercise and had a hard time to tell myself to stop as apparently perfection wasn't required just yet...

What can I improve on next sprint?

Keep the rhythm. Try a bit more of the meditation practices.
