 What did I do well this sprint?
 I really enjoyed the minesweeper challenges.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 It was a bit of a tiring week at work, so I lost motivation a little towards the end of the sprint.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Still fighting with Toggl every now and then. Should finally figure it out and not always forget to turn it on or off.
