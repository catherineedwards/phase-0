What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I developed a good habit of doing a little bit almost every single day, so there was never any panic of not finishing things on time.
I also made sure that I looked after myself in between studying and working and tried some new meditation techniques that should be useful for the future.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

Sometimes I felt I was going a bit slow and I often got side-tracked on doing just a little more CSS when I got stuck in JS. I probably should have tried asking for help every now and then rather than swearing at the computer, especially during the minesweeper and the open project.

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

I learned to switch off any distractions such as Facebook during learning time, it's amazing how much easier it is to concentrate without these things. The "Search inside yourself" book was very interesting in preparation for working with others, which is something I have not done much of just because of the nature of my jobs in the past but which is something I'm really looking forward to.
