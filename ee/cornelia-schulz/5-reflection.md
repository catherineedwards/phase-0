 What did I do well this sprint?
 I loved all the JavaScript exercises and had a lot of fun with them.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I'm not great at writing blog posts and kept procratinating when it came to write them up. Suddenly there was so much to do in the house.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Hopefully with a bit more mindfulness training, I can bring my focus back to writing blogs next sprint.
