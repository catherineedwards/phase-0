What did I do well this sprint?

I found myself really enjoying going through the html and css course on Udacity and play around with the portfolio they gave as example. Most evenings I was able to focus really well on all the course material.


What didn't I do well this sprint?

Switching off at night time was hard - I was still coding in my dreams and didn't get enough sleep. 


What can I improve on next sprint?

I'm hoping to establish a proper routine with the next sprint.
