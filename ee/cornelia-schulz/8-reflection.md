 What did I do well this sprint?

I really enjoyed the calculator challenge. I took my time to work through the user stories and even though a little frustrating at times, it was great when things came together at the end.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I really struggled writing the cultural blog this sprint. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?

I think a good thing to take away from the challenge this sprint is that it is best to break things down into manageable chunks and draw things out wherever possible.
