 What did I do well this sprint?
 I think I managed to work my way very focused through the JavaScript exercises and enjoyed them a lot.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I constantly forgot toggl this sprint, either left it on for ages or simply forgot to turn it on. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Get back to a proper routine. Guests and a long weekend made this sprint rather chaotic.
