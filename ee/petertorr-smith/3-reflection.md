# Sprint 3 Reflection #

## What did I do well this sprint? ##
* Got through the materials and the exercises
* Kept looking up things I'd forgotten or needed to learn (usually CSS)
* Allowed the confusion over the Skeleton structure to be ok, and to work through the learning process until things became clearer
* Let go of many aspects of "perfection" for my site.... ok to move on to next exercise now.

## What didn't I do well this sprint? ##
* Too many late nights and late starts
* Too much time on revisiting the same layout and tweaking it, when I should've got the content in place. 
* Watching videos but not taking notes or applying them or following through, so needed to watch again or find bits to see how they did something.
## What can I improve on next sprint? ##
* Capture notes or do some practice as watching videos or reading an article.
* Better time-boxing.  
* Using the Pomodoro 25 min timer to focus on one thing.
* Finish earlier to get some relax/fun time in before sleep (TV, reading, friends/family/phone)
