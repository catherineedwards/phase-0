# Sprint 5 Reflection, and other notes.


## What did I do well this sprint?
I got into the technical readings and challenges quickly and nailed through the technical aspects of the sprint in 2-3 days. I also coupled that with reasonably regular meditation.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I lagged behind / got blocked on the blogs, and I burnt myself out with some very late nights doing the tech assignments.
I said to myself I was going to get up early to study, but I've yet to get that pattern sorted.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Writing this at the end of sprint-6, so I can see the things i'm needing to do is get more sleep. 
I'm pumped up by the tech learnings and my own journey "getting things", that it's been easy to jump into the next tech challenges. So a bit more balance (sleep, other activities/people) is something to improve on.


# Extra: My Slack checkin on Friday (already well into sprint-6)
Which sprint am I working on?`
* Sprint 6 just finished the technical aspects, and just posted second blog for sprint 5.  
* So basically finishing Sprint 6 now, hoping to get into Sprint 7 this weekend.
Am I keeping up with the material? If not, why not?
* Yep, happy with progress. I do find I get ahead on something, usually technical, then slow down a bit, and then the blog posts and sprint admin take more time than expected.
Am I blocked on anything?
* Just the blog posts really.  I am a bit tired of all the manual HTML (repetitive) when I know any real blog solution handles this.
* So I'm now writing my blog post content separately, usually in a Google Doc, and finish the content before getting into the HTML and copy and paste.
What are my stress levels?
* Pretty low, though I have this niggling feeling often that I've forgotten everything I learned in previous sprints.  But I do force myself to do a quick google to find the correct HTML or JS approach, and then put it into action, knowing that it is only repitition and practice that lead to understanding and fluency.
What are my frustrations?
* As I've been a programmer before, I'm trying to structure my code well and practice DRY.  However I know that that perfection seeking part of me can get in the way of the lesson, so I just let it be what it is and focus on the lesson and task at hand, and that helps.
Which concepts I found most interesting
* Javascript for sure, and the basic fundamentals of arrays and objects and iterations and EventListeners.
* The EventListeners is a new approach for me, and the document.getElement.... functions to update DOM elements. My background in Ruby on Rails (and ASP/ASP.Net) uses a different approach, with variables inside the HTML markup that get replaced when the page is rendered.  Though that is server-side, and we are playing with client-side code that updates the page after it's loaded.
Make progress in other areas (30 mins typing practice/week, 2 mins meditation/day, etc...)
* have been doing about 15 mins of meditation each day, and feel good about that.
