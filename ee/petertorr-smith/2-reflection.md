22/8 taking a slow time to get into this.  Still going in slowly to get over the materials before medium dive into concepts.
Bought HTML and CSS for dummies Kindle book, started reading on the plane... want to get through a bit of it as good for foundations.

Tēnā koutou katoa i tēnei ahiahi
Hello all of you this evening

Checking in after having yesterday off work and study with wisdom teeth surgery... lots of fun indeed!

Anyway...

<h1>How are you doing personally? </h1>
A bit physically bruised and beaten in my jaw. Was wiped out all of yesterday and a crazy night's sleep after sedatives and painkillers.  But recovering well I think, but eating has been a bit challenging today.
I'm feeling good about life in general and am enjoying my path mostly.  I finish work on Thursday, so I've got a number of things to finish off for MSD next week. After that It's full-time Dev Academy for the remaining 5 weeks before bootcamp!

I'm  about half-way through Sprint 2, so not speedy but definitely enjoying the learning and working.

<h1>How are you doing technically? </h1>
I'm still going slow but steady through the materials, lessons and practice.  Got through the Grid and Bootstrap lessons and loved that. Grid and Bootstrap certainly help out a lot!

I like how it allows us to assign lots of classes to an element but makes each class selector and declaration only responsible for a single task, such as UPPERCASING with .text-uppercase.  Good guidance for our own stylesheets I suspect.

The tutorials and lessons have helped link things together for me.  Working now to publish my Tech Blog part 1.


<h1>If you could live in any place in the world (air land sea and space!) where would it be? </h1>

I'm thinking Northland at Shipwreck bay on Te-Oneroa-a-Tōhē/Ninety Mile Beach. Good weather, fishing and surf.
Or perhaps Valencia or Barcelona, overlooking the mediterrean :slightly_smiling_face:
My Māori ancestry, where my grandmother grew-up, is from Wairoa.  I do like Mahia.

Love Wellington, but could enjoy some time in Queensland for the winter :slightly_smiling_face:


Other notes, as just finishes Bootstrap and Grid lessons and now putting it into action in my T2 blog.



End of Sprint Reflection.
    What did I do well this sprint?
        Thoughtful blog posts.
        All the udacity learnings, and the optional exercises.  
        Grid layout for revised page layout.

    What didn't I do well this sprint?
        Forgot CSS basics re floating, postioning, as was focusing on Grid.
        Git merge didn't go so well (did my own pull request to explore the process), so have much more to learn there.
    What can I improve on next sprint?
        Perhaps keep the pace up, work for longer periods of time without distraction.
        Need to rework home page.
        CSS focus.
        Branch for all changes, not work on master.
END.
