# What did I do well this sprint?
Paired up for two days with James. Got me out of house and focused on challenge.
Meditated almost every day.
Swim, walk, time with partner


# What didn't I do well this sprint?
Had a few days where I planned to do about 8 hours but only managed to do about 3 or 4. 


# What can I improve on next sprint?
Set MVP and time-box for challenges.
Keep it simple.
Don't overcommit, but don't underestimate sprint-9 review effort
