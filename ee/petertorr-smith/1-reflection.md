 What did I do well this sprint?

Worked through all the materials, absorbing them and understanding them, and did not stress about how long it took me.  I valued the learning process, and slowing down my mind to read and absorb, to do tutorials and interactive learning tools.


 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I took a long time, and it was quite fragmented.  I think more timeboxing in future sprints would be a good discipline.  I also was a tad inconsistent with Toggl, and had to change start/end times manually to get it sort-of reflective of my efforts.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

 Timeboxing for an hour (or a few pomodoros).
 Try get through readings a tad faster (focus/attention).
 Keep-up the meditation, try some different types of meditation (I to TM meditation for 20mins in the morning)
