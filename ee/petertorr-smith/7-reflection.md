# Sprint-7 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
Worked through all the functional programming exercises, taking several breaks.
Did all the 'Functional Programming' exercises, not those listed in the 7.0 Functional Workshop ticket. I felt that was worthwhile to reinforce some basics. 


## What didn't I do well this sprint?
Persisted through the mind-twist of functional programming.  Especially not changing variables!

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Capture blog thoughts as I go.
