# Sprint 6 Reflection

## What did I do well this sprint?
As per Sprint-5, I got into the technical readings and challenges quickly and nailed through the technical aspects of the sprint in 2-3 days. I also coupled that with reasonably regular meditation.
I also have been getting more sleep.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I lagged behind / got blocked on the blogs, I suspect because I know I have to think about my content and write it, and I like to do this well so it takes time.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Capture blog content ideas as I work through the sprint, readings and exercises.
