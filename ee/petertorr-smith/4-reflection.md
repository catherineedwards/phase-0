# What did I do well this sprint?
I got underway with a hiss and a roar and managed to power through the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Basics at a good pace.

It did still take me just over 10 hours to get through them, but I took the time to understand each command and action and lesson.
# What didn't I do well this sprint?
I got caught up feeling like I was nearly finished, then relaxed a bit too much on Saturday and Sunday.  I also felt some resistence getting the content of my blog post sorted.  This time I decided to separate the content from the page construction, so wrote the essence of my post in a Google Doc, before then turning to my HTML page to load the content. I think that helped, if not for the speed, but at least for the quality of the content.

# What can I improve on next sprint?
As I need to get through 5 sprints in under 4 weeks, I'll need to be smart with timeboxing my study efforts and noticing where I resist / avoid :-)
