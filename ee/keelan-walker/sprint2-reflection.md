What did I do well this sprint?
Grrr, really hard question to answer for a number of reasons given the time I spent away from this sprint.  But that can be covered in the next question.

I think I did well in the paying back technical debt section where we were asked to tidy up 'Sam's untidy code'.  Although I'm sure my editing and correcting wasn't perfect, I felt reasonable comfortable given that many of the <TAGS> were unfamiliar to me.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
First mistake was the length of time I spent away from the sprint.  On trying to come back and pick up where I left off, I found I had forgotten some really key skills which we had learnt in the last sprint to enable me to finish the sprint comfortably. This meant having to go back and refresh.

I also struggled with understanding the area around creating gitpull requests and working in in temporary sub branches?

What can I improve on next sprint?
Easy question.  Consistency as far as continuing to study/put aside time to study each day.  I think going back over the work I have completed is also important, as a way to reinforce what I have learnt.
