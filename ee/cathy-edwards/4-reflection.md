This sprint, I felt I grasped the basics of JavaScript pretty well.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
When it came to applying the basics of JavaScript into a complex use case, I admittedly struggled. I struggle when I don't have anyone to talk through the problem and getting feedback.

# What can I improve on next sprint?
Next sprint I will take my time and read through the study materials more diligently.
