# What did I do well this sprint?
* I felt like I blogged really well and really happily this week.
* I felt good about completing my EDA work despite being so sick with the head cold.
* I readily picked up new concepts comfortably.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
* I didn't fully understand the grid system, but I am sure I will learn more about that with future exercises.
* I didn't keep up my Headspace meditations this week.
* I pushed too hard with trying to do some EDA work while sick, and ended up being more sick.

# What can I improve on next sprint?
* I will make time in particular for meditation to help lift my mood.
* I will focus on completing Sprint 3 by Friday 24 August.
* I will enhance my focus with more discipline using the Pomodoro method.
