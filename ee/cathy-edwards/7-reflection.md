# What did I do well this sprint?
I mastered the art of persistence! I pushed myself to keeping at it with an exercise until I solved the problem. I also learnt how to use the MDN Web docs to learn how to use functions that were new to me. I also got my head around parameters and using arguments in different layers of locality in loops and functions. Yay! I also improved my timeboxing.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
On reflection, I wish I had managed my time better throughout Phase 0. Maybe I'm being a little hard on myself, but I do wish I had left myself more than a week to get through Sprints 8 and 9 :|

# What can I improve on next sprint?
S m a s h i n g goals so I can get into my cohort! I'm so excited for 15 October!
