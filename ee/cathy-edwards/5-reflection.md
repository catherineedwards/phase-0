# What did I do well this sprint?
This sprint I felt a massive confidence boost with solving the problems, particularly when I spoke out loud with an experienced software developer.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
I completely failed at timeboxing this sprint. I spent an hour and a half metaphorically belting my head on the desk trying to solve the exercises in EloquentJavascript.

# What can I improve on next sprint?
Mastering the art of timeboxing with a rubber ducky, even if I have to buy a physical rubber ducky. This will help my brain clarify my problem solving techniques.
