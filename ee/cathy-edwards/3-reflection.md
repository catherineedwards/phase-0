# What did I do well this sprint?
* I was really happy with timeboxing my work and my efforts to complete the exercises in this sprint.
* I feel (mostly) caught up with all of my work from when I was sick.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
* I felt my wire-framing was out of sync from how grid-based design should be used.

# What can I improve on next sprint?
* I will build my wire-framing based on the 12 column grid system.
* I will also start my after-work study earlier in the evenings.
