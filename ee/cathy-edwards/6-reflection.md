# What did I do well this sprint?
This sprint, I was really happy with how I timeboxed my coding effort, and found a great study-life balance while wrapping up my last weeks with work. My last weeks with my full-time job were quite stressful, but I am very happy with what I delivered to my client and for their project.

I was able to find points when I was going down proverbial rabbit holes and getting myself wound up. I knew how to walk away, get some peace, and reflect for a different approach for my next attempt at the exercise.

I also unexpectedly found myself with merge conflicts in my repo, but I was able to resolve them without getting freaked out! Big victory for me :)

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
This sprint, I left too much time between attempts at the Minesweeper exercise. I found myself coming back to the exercise and finding that I had to teach myself again where I was in the code and where I was in the context of the exercise. I also overcomplicated things and over thought solutions to problems: in fact, I didn't take time to understand the problem itself. I tried to understand it while solving it.

# What can I improve next sprint?
Next sprint, I am going to not be overwhelmed by both work and study. It will just be study. But that means a lot of discipline, too! I'm in the home stretch for the lead up to my actual boot camp, and I have to do 3 sprints in 2 weeks. All of my learnings to date will push me through for success!
