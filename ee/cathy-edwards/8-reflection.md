I pushed through and kept at the material without procrastinating. I got this sprint done in record time! I also researched a lot as I went through the material, boosting my knowledge.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
I was pretty happy with how I went this sprint. I wish I were better at stringing functions together, but I will learn with time and practice.

# What can I improve next sprint?
If I don't understand something, I'll go and watch a YouTube video about it. I'm finding I'm learning much better through people talking through code.
