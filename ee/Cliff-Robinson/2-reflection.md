What did I do well this Sprint?

    I got through the tutorials quickly and well. 

What didn't I do well this Sprint?

    The technical debt task was a bit bumpy, and that reduced my motivation to keep working. 

What can I improve on next Sprint?

    Time management is improving from Sprint 1, although there's more room to grow. As I write this I've started Sprint 3 and a lot of what's in my head more applies there than to Sprint 2. Maybe I need to keep the fact that I'm doing these reflections in mind during the sprints so I can use this exercise more effectively.
