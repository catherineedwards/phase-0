What did I do well this sprint?

I got through the JS material really quickly, it almost all felt very familiar and straightforward, although JS syntax is still a little odd to me. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

It took me a long time to get to doing the mindful conversation exercise, partly because I wanted my Dad to read the chapter and I didn't want rush him, but also because both of us were oddly nervous about doing it. I guess there is a sense of fear of being vulnerable. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

As I write this, I've already completed the next sprint, so it's a little academic (I got on with the technical stuff while waiting on the cultural stuff). But essentially, the answer is to keep going on the tech side, practice my JS syntax, and don't let the cultural stuff slide.
