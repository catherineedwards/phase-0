What did I do well this sprint?

This was another sprint where I engaged with the material well, and got the chance be slightly creative with the projects - building something slightly more complex than the instructions given, which is nice. 

I also asked about something which was confusing me about JS and got a really informative answer from Rich, which I think will help me build on my understanding. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

Because I delayed on my cultural work last sprint, I also delayed on this one, because I didn't want to jump ahead. Search inside yourself has a lot of useful plateau busting excercises, and I want to make sure I actually use them,

What can I improve on next sprint?

I want to try and do the meditation circuit training exercise from SIY every day, it would be a solid first step to applying the ideas within. The technical work seems to be coming along nicely, although I should keep asking questions.
