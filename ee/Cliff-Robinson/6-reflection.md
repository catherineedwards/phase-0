What did I do well this sprint?

I'm really pleased with my little game, so much so that I've shared the link to it on Facebook. The structured work went quickly, and I had enough html/css knowlege to make a nice looking website to house it, which is not one of my strengths, so it's nice to be getting better. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

My cultural blog was very short. I think I can reflect more on the material within. I find it hard to articulate what it's talking about, although I feel I do try and apply its principles on a nonverbal level. 

Also, gitHub continues to confuse me, which delayed rolling out my project a lot. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

Try reading the cultural blog chapter earlier and penning some basic thoughts before finishing the technical stuff, to come back to later.
