What did I do well this Sprint?

    I completed the assignments quickly, and started to develop better personal timekeeping and health habits to promote future productivity (getting up earlier, planning my day, etc).

What didn't I do well this Sprint?

    I'm not especially pleased with the design of my website. I could look into CSS more on my own to redesign it, but I suspect a lot of that will be taught in future materials. Still, it doesn't sit well with me to submit work that I feel could be better. 

What can I improve on next Sprint?

    Learn more CSS techniques, but more importantly, continue to improve my time management. I want to get to a position where I'm starting to work (which means having completed my 10 minutes mediation and 15 minutes workout) at around 8.10am, so that when bootcamp begins I can get that done and take 20min to get to campus on time.
