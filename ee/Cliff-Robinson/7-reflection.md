What did I do well this sprint?

Again, the technical work was good. I possibly spent too much time on the freecodecamp stuff, but that was in part because I had time to kill while waiting for a pairing partner for sprint 8.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I'm unsure of how to characterise my cultural blog work. I did read the chapter several times alongside my technical work, and although I put off writing cblog 7 I think once I finally did I had some really useful insights.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Again, I'm writing this after getting most of the way through sprint 8. I am trying to be better on my cultural blogging and have been reading the chapter, but I still need to put my thoughts to paper sooner.
