### What did I do well this sprint?

Sticking to my timeboxing well. As I was going through the freecode camp exercises I kept an eye on the time I was spending. I even set an alarm for when my maximum time was up in my last stint of my 4 hours. This is the kind of thing I could easily get carried away with and completyl lose track of time.

### What didn't I do well this sprint?

I was forgetting to do the meditaion exercises every day. I have been able to do a few groups of mindful breaths every day which is the minumum I need to be doing but should be doing more.

### What can I improve on next sprint?

Do a few minutes of meditation and a body scan each day.
