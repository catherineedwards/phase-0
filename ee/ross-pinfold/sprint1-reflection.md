What did I do well this sprint?
I took the time to read resources before jumping in to assignments, I was eager to just jump straight into the assignments and workout what I needed to know as I went along. Reading the rescources gave me a much clearer understanding of HTML and CSS. I possibly could have got through the sprint quicker if I'd skiped the reading but I wouldnt have learnt as much.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didnt skim through the list of assignments before starting, I missed 1.0 how to waffle as was at bottom, for 1.1 and 1.2 opened up in new github tab instead of clicking the number to open the window in waffle. Found it alot easier once I worked out how to do it properly.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Manage time better, I'll try skimming through all assignments at start of sprint and work out how much time I should be spending on each one.
