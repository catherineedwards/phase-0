What did I do well This sprint?

  I managed my time beter this sprint, I looked through the whole sprint and planned what I wanted to get done each day. I broke it up into smaller sections and was more concious about taking breaks and not just pushing through when things took longer than I planned.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

  I didnt pay careful enough attention to the instructions, found myself on the wrong udacity lesson 1 after signing up and spent 2 hours working through the wrong lessons thinking I already know all this from last sprint. At least I got some additional background in html and css, did help drum it a bit.

What can I improve on next sprint?

  Pay more attention to instructions to make sure Im doing the right stuff.
