What did I do well this sprint?

I attempted to answer someone elses question on slack. I dont know if it would of been any help or not. My natural response would be that someone else probaly knows more and leave it for someone else to answer. But trying to improve my communication skills for this so offered an idea of what I thought the problem might be. If it was of no help no-one loses anything but if it helps it helps. I do like to help and if someone asks me something direct I will always try my best to answer, but normaly woulnd't offer anything to a general request like we get on slack. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

Keep enthusiatic while writing my blogs. Im really enjoying the coding excercises but not so much the blogging. They will be helping develop my communication skils which is good but I struggle to feel enthusiastic about it. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

Continue working on communication, keep trying to give full honest answers when blogging rather thann just getting it out of the way.
