### What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I manageed my time quite well, I was able to get motovated to get the tasks done. I was able to follow along with the technical side quite well. There were some areas where the coding seemed quite easy but I took the time to read and proccess everything, not skip over anything I thought I already knew. I learnt alot of things that I may have missed if I was just rushing through everything.

### What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I could have practiced the meditation techniques more. They do seem useful but I would do them once or twice and then forget about them. I can see the use for bootcamp so would be helpful if I can get more practiced in it. There is still time before bootcamp so I should try to fit some meditation practice in. 

### What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

Time management skills, The meditation techniques from search inside yourself will be really useful to me. During bootcamp I inted to use meditation to help me relax at the end the long days, to help with handling stress and winding down so I can get important sleep time. Alot of the stuff from search inside your self will also be helpful in getting along with at accepting doffent ideas with my peers at bootcamp. I am imagining it will be a highly stresssful situation for everyone and it will be important not to let the stress cause friction between anyone.
