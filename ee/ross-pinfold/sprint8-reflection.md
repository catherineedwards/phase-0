### What did I do well this sprint?

Worked through my calculator one function at a time, remembering to do lots of commits. Its easy for me to just go for it and write all the code I can see in my head. but its much better to keep to the structure that we are learning. Certainly makes it easier to figure out why things arent working when your only trying to debug a few lines of code.

### What didn't I do well this sprint?

Got really blocked on the cultural blog, was getting distracted with work and other stuff and couldnt think of what to do the exercise on. 

### What can I improve on next sprint?

Stay foucused while working on the sprint, keep practicing the meditation techniques.
