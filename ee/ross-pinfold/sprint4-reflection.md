What did I do well this sprint?

I went through all the freecode camp exercises even though I already did them before I started with phase-0. I found this sprint quite easy as I had already done most of it, but was definitaly worthwile repeating as it takes repetition for everything to sink in. There were exercises that I had completly forgotton in the month or so since I first did them.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

Still struggling to keep structured time keeping. Find myself getting too involved in a task and forgetting to take breaks.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Practice the meditation techniques we are learning in our cultural exercises more. I like them when I read them but struggle to keep doing them for more than a day or so. I only remember about them when it comes time to read the next chapter for the next sprint.
