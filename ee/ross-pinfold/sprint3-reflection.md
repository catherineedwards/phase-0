What did I do well this sprint?
I stayed focused when creating my website, I followed instructions and tried to go through the proper process and added and tested one thing at a time strting from the structure so I could see everything was working before moving to the next step.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I lost motivation when it came to doing the blogs, I still got them done and did have to fit work in, but was finding myself procrastinating and could have finished sooner. 


What can I improve on next sprint?
Stay foucused and keep up the momentum throughout the sprint.
