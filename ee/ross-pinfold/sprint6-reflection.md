### What did I do well this sprint?

I kept to my timebox allocation when developing minesweeper. Some things took quite a bit of time to figure out why they weren't working when adding finishing touches. I would have liked to do more but the time I had allocated was up so tidied up the features I had implemented and it would do for now. Probably could have spent a couple of days improving it. 

### What didn't I do well this sprint?

Think about multiple reasons something wasn't working while trouble shooting. A couple of times I spent a lot of time following what I thought was causing a problem only to eventually find it was something else. 

### What can I improve on next sprint?

Speed up on my problem solving by considering as many causes as possible for why something isn't working. And try small things which will indicate if any of them are the cause of the problems before getting too deep into rewriting stuff that may be fine as it is.
