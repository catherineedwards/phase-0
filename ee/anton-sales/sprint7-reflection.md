What did I do well this sprint?
I have a better understanding of javascript than the last sprint which is a great improvement for me. I still need a lot of understanding for it to fully make sense but it's getting there.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
The amount of hours I studied this sprint was significantly lower than the other sprints as this week was had quite a lot of family and work related things that had to be done.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 timebox atleast 2-3 hours a day on a task.
